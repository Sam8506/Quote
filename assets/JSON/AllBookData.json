          "Book-description": "An author, neuroscientist, and computer engineer unveils a theory of intelligence, of understanding the brain and the future of AI. For all of neuroscience's advances, we've made little progress on its biggest question: How do simple cells in the brain create intelligence? Jeff Hawkins and his team discovered that the brain uses maplike structures to build a model of the world-not just one model, but hundreds of thousands of models of everything we know. This discovery allows Hawkins to answer important questions about how we perceive the world, why we have a sense of self, and the origin of high-level thought. ",

          "Book-summary": "I’ll focus on the first section because that’s where my main interests lie. The second section of the book is diving into the future of humanity, AI safety, space exploration, and many more interesting topics. I enjoyed all these, but I admit, I wanted more juicy neocortex meat.               I’ve been a fan of Jeff Hawkins since ~2009 when I read his first book, On Intelligence - his HTM theory and what it implied was inspiring to say the least. It was the first attempt that I heard of that tried to create a theory of how the neocortex works. The second book expands on the HTM and attempts to complete it. Armed with a decade+ of AI and neuroscience knowledge at Numenta he develops a new theory of the mind called A thousand brains.              Note that these are all high-level concepts that are useful to explain how it’s all supposed to work. There are no “objects” or “reference frames” in the brain - there are synapses, dendrites, cortical columns, minicolumns, grid and place cells (or at least growing evidence that they exist), axons, etc… but it’s hard to explain how intelligence works by using the “hardware” components alone. It’s like trying to explain how a combustion engine works using quantum mechanics - it’s possible, but it’s not the right level of abstraction. The first part of the book is defining this abstraction and connecting it with the different “hardware” parts of the brain.                      The what (sensory input) and the where (reference frames) of each model are tightly coupled inside a cortical column. The refs are “implemented” by place and grid cells together with other parts of the cortical column. The evidence that these grid/place or “location” cells exist in the neocortex is not confirmed yet, but there is growing evidence.                  There are long-distance connections between columns, inside the same cortical region (Ex: visual) and between regions (Ex: visual and touch). I think this image of the Rubin vase here can give you a clue about what happens. Your brain tries to decide between 2 different equally valid models. What’s curious is that you can see either a vase or 2 faces, but not both at once.It appears that the “motivation” or “goals” of the brain is not set in the neocortex, but in the “old” brain and there is a constant “battle” between the two. The “old” brain wants to eat the marshmallow, but the new one has a model of you on a diet. Is this accurate? If yes, then what is the mechanism of this interaction? Is it confirmed that grid and place cells exist in the neocortex? It’s a key part of the theory. Recursion (around language and other nested concepts) was mentioned, but I’m not sure I understood how it works.",

          "Book-description": "No fictional character is more renowned for his powers of thought and observation than Sherlock Holmes. But is his extraordinary intellect merely a gift of fiction, or can we learn to cultivate these abilities ourselves, to improve our lives at work and at home?  We can, says psychologist and journalist Maria Konnikova, and in Mastermind she shows us how. Beginning with the \"brain attic\"--Holmes's metaphor for how we store information and organize knowledge--Konnikova unpacks the mental strategies that lead to clearer thinking and deeper insights. Drawing on twenty-first-century neuroscience and psychology, Mastermind explores Holmes's unique methods of ever-present mindfulness, astute observation, and logical deduction.  In doing so, it shows how each of us, with some self-awareness and a little practice, can employ these same methods to sharpen our perceptions, solve difficult problems, and enhance our creative powers. For Holmes aficionados and casual readers alike, Konnikova reveals how the world's most keen-eyed detective can serve as an unparalleled guide to upgrading the mind.",

          "Book-summary": "Lesson 1: Learn to harness your conscious system and notice the patterns of the reflexive one As humans, we are wired in curious ways. Take our brain for example. We have a conscious mind that can actively think about problems, ways to fix them, interpret surroundings, and many more. Then, there’s our reflexive system, which takes the first answer as the correct one.   Now, guess which one we’re using more. Hint: It’s the reflexive system! Our brain is self-trained to save energy and interpret surroundings in the most convenient way. However, if you want to make the most out of your thinking processes, you’ll have to learn to use your active cognitive power.  To do so, psychologists call for mindfulness, which is the part art part science of living in the moment, actively acknowledging surroundings and feelings, and overall being aware. This system takes energy and focus, which is why it is not easy for us to engage with it.  However, if you want to think reasonably and logically, you’ll have to keep reminding your brain that it must be proactive, engaged, and aware. You must give yourself a wake up call in the face of challenges and actively think about solutions while questioning assumptions, rather than take the easy way out.                           Lesson 2: To declutter the brain and think better, you’ll have to understand how to store information The brain works enough on its own to make you function, but when it comes to proactive thinking, you’ll have to bring consciousness into play. Therefore, in the face of unsolvable mysteries, Holmes was doing just that.   One good way to do so is by training your brain to remember important information and structure it in a user-friendly way. Holmes thinks of his brain as an attic where information gets stored. The attic hosts contents (experiences, memories, information, knowledge) and structures (the way you store the content).  Therefore, you can actively decide where and how to store content and move it around to create blocks of specific information. You can even try it right now, by adding all this information into a mind block called psychological tricks, for example.   Now, Holmes also keeps a main attic folder in his brain, which constantly stores important and urgent information that he needs. This information helps him solve cases. Therefore, to retain such pieces of data, you’ll have to motivate yourself to remember them. Link it to already existing information or make it as tangible as possible.                          Lesson 3: Biases, the weather, our faulty assumptions, and many other factors alter our decision-making process Naturally, our decision-making process is constantly changing based on our life experiences, information accumulated over time, interactions with other people, and many other factors. In other words, we are inclined towards certain biases that alter our judgement.  To break free from them and achieve maximum objectivity, we’ll have to acknowledge them first. Neuropsychology shows that we like to make decisions based on the rule of thumb. Some of our decisions are a result of the availability heuristic, which implies that we judge based on how much information we can remember.  Obviously, other bits of data could change the entire decision, yet we choose to answer right away even if we know that we can’t recall the entire information. We’re also biased to judge people based on our first impression of them or what other people said about them.  These biases, and many others, affect our judgement heavily and can alter the entire course of a decision. For this reason, we must force ourselves to be objective and have all the information available before making a decision. Moreover, it’s best to always doubt ourselves and try to notice biased patterns.",

          "Book-description ": "AN INSTANT NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER! A young entrepreneur makes the case that politics has no place in business, and sets out a new vision for the future of American capitalism. There’s a new invisible force at work in our economic and cultural lives. It affects every advertisement we see and every product we buy, from our morning coffee to a new pair of shoes.  “Stakeholder capitalism” makes rosy promises of a better, more diverse, environmentally-friendly world, but in reality this ideology championed by America’s business and political leaders robs us of our money, our voice, and our identity.   Vivek Ramaswamy is a traitor to his class. He’s founded multibillion-dollar enterprises, led a biotech company as CEO, he became a hedge fund partner in his 20s, trained as a scientist at Harvard and a lawyer at Yale, and grew up the child of immigrants in a small town in Ohio. Now he takes us behind the scenes into corporate boardrooms and five-star conferences, into Ivy League classrooms and secretive nonprofits, to reveal the defining scam of our century.   The modern woke-industrial complex divides us as a people.  By mixing morality with consumerism, America’s elites prey on our innermost insecurities about who we really are. They sell us cheap social causes and skin-deep identities to satisfy our hunger for a cause and our search for meaning, at a moment when we as Americans lack both.   This book not only rips back the curtain on the new corporatist agenda, it offers a better way forward. America’s elites may want to sort us into demographic boxes, but we don’t have to stay there. Woke, Inc. begins as a critique of stakeholder capitalism and ends with an exploration of what it means to be an American in 2021—a journey that begins with cynicism and ends with hope.   ",

          "Book-summary ": "Lesson 1: Corporations use the woke culture to pursue their lucrative goals It’s no secret that all companies pursue profits. However, the way they do so tells a lot about them. Big corporations have taken over the woke culture, which originated with the phrase “stay woke” used by black people to stay alert to racism in their societies. Now, wokeness is about keeping an eye open for racism, gender discrimination, civil rights, and other similar causes.   Corporations often love to put their logo on the hottest trends and advocate for honorable causes. However, instead of being genuine in their intentions, they donate prizes and create opportunities only to gain more in the end. On top of that, they use a rather “political” way of showcasing things.  Take Goldman Sachs for example – the Wall Street investment company. They recently advocated for a new policy they implemented: they’ll only take public companies that have a “diverse” board. For them, diversity meant female board members. The catch? All the companies in the S&P500 already had a female board member, so it wasn’t an uncommon thing to find that structure. Their risk was nearly zero, yet the gains were immense.                      Lesson 2: Mixing politics and business is a dangerous combination for the world Big corporations like to play safe and keep the odds in their favor. For this reason, pleasing shareholders, which is the core essence of any company, isn’t enough anymore. Stakeholders like the government, the political parties, suppliers, and the society are now among the most important external factors of influence of any company.  In order to fulfill their wishes, corporations often adhere to the woke culture that seems to have taken over the world in an over-aggressive way. Coca-Cola started holding classes about “how to be less white”, and if an employee doesn’t want to participate in it, they can expect to be fired. This organization isn’t the only one that does so, and the employees have had enough of it.  Currently, there are many ongoing trials regarding a new type of discrimination, where companies turn against people who don’t want to mix politics with business. However, in a world dominated by political parties, corporations feel the pressure of choosing a side, and sadly, being on the winning side implies bringing politics to the workplace.                                Lesson 3: Corporations are hiding under false virtues while witnessing real-life crises in their face Another way through which corporations make profits is by selling your data to larger powers, such as governments. Take Airbnb for example – the company possessed huge amounts of data from its American users. Top destinations, emails with customers, travel habits, and demographic factors of users are all in the hands of Airbnb.   To make room for business in China, the Communist Party requested that information for their own benefit. Since profits come first, Airbnb handed over those valuable insights. Then, they closed an eye to all the oppression they saw in China and never spoke a word about their own doings, all while promoting virtuous causes in the US.  Corporations act like heroes publicly, yet they have a tendency to be dictators themselves behind closed doors. Firstly, they earn users’ trust through the woke culture, then they monetize their data through ads, on top of the regular revenue gained. Selling data has become the hottest trend among corporations, and it’s taking a heavy toll on consumers.   Since profits are just part of their operations, they must also seek power to keep their status. For this reason, Big Tech controls the media and only promotes causes that help them stay in charge.

          "Book-summary ": "Lesson 1: Don’t fall into the trap of materialism set by advertisers. As humans, we are visual creatures. We love to look at things, feel them, showcase them, and advertisers know it. In fact, this is how they build their successful businesses and manage to get into our minds. They make us think that the key to happiness lies in more and more possessions. They create ads that are meant to be glamorous and desirable. And they promise that once you buy yourself a particular thing, you’ll be happy, or at least happier.   In fact, spending more makes you inflate your lifestyle, increases your desire to buy more and more things and achieve that promised happiness, all while keeping you engaged in this vicious cycle. On top of that, all these things keep you from targeting your focus and resources towards your true purpose. Therefore, to live meaningfully, you’ll have to start adopting a more minimalist lifestyle and try to find happiness in undertaking purposeful endeavors, rather than buying unnecessary luxuries.   Although we may not realize it, we’re wired to the idea that material things bring happiness. Therefore, we pick higher-paying jobs instead of pursuing our dream careers. Then, we feel frustrated and miserable, living every day feeling like we have no real meaning. How disappointing! It’s time to step back and reconsider your priorities. For example, if you’re hardly ever at home, you probably don’t need a condo with a view, right? The lesson here is to find meaning in what you do, rather than through your possessions and spending money to feel better.                          Lesson 2: Finding your purpose is your most intimate experience, so don’t let anyone ruin it for you. As we go through life, there are certain occasions when we experience remarkable, electrifying experiences that no one but ourselves seems to understand. For a passionate mechanic, it can be pretty difficult to explain why fixing a car gives him an inexplicable sense of satisfaction and happiness. Still, it does, and even if repairing cars is not your thing, you too have something that sparks a little light in your heart when you encounter it.  Frankly, whatever that is, you should pursue it, above all other variables. Material things are just a trap set by profit-seekers, as we’ve discussed in the previous lesson. So how about other obstacles you may face? Here I’m trying to emphasize the enormous impact our friends and family have on us. Although we may not realize it, the people we surround ourselves with play an important role in our development and our future actions.  Most often than not, we’re afraid of what our relatives, friends, and community will have to say about our decisions. Unfortunately, this thought can hold us back from achieving our dreams. In the end, it all comes down to what you love doing. Therefore, mark down the times when you feel most alive when something clicks in your head and your heart, and when you feel happy doing something. Then, try to pursue those things and make them part of your life. It doesn’t matter if it brings you financial benefits or what your acquaintances would think.                       Lesson 3: Living according to your own definition of happiness will make the universe work even harder for you. If you’ve discovered your purpose and you’re ready to live according to your own happiness formula, congrats! You’re halfway there! Living a happy, meaningful life is definitely achievable, yet the how part is something you’ll have to figure out on your own. While there are ways to help yourself discover what your purpose is and how to overcome challenges in the process of self-discovery, there’s no such thing as a one size fits all formula for living your life.  Simply put, you must pursue whatever makes you happy, in a way that makes you happy. If you find pleasure in working as little as possible and spending time with your family, so be it. If you enjoy painting for hours and hours every day, try to do it as much as possible. While there’s no right way to live your life, there is a wrong way – not following your inner purpose. On top of that, it gets even better!   Once you start living meaningfully, the universe will make everything else happen for you. Haven’t you noticed how people who seem to be the most fulfilled are also extremely lucky? It’s like everything is working in their favor! Well, maybe it is like that. Live purposefully, and good luck and happiness will follow. It’s just an unwritten rule of life. And fortunately, there’s no amount of money in the world that can fix this rule if you don’t follow all the steps.",

          "Book-summary ": "Lesson 1: All businesses start from an idea, but always leave some room for design and adjustments Let’s say that one day you stumble across a great business idea. You cannot wait to draw up a plan and put it into practice. In your mind, this idea seems to be worth millions. There’s no way you can fail by going with it. Unfortunately, this is where most entrepreneurs are greatly mistaken. Many of them rush into the market without considering more perspectives and leaving room for redesigning their concept.   The design loop is a way to tweak initial ideas. It has two phases: the first one looks a lot like brainstorming. You get to idealize and come up with multiple concepts, without stumbling upon only one good idea. The second phase is about narrowing down options and synthesizing your ideas into a few promising options. The author suggests using the Business Model Canvas that he created to go through these phases.   This canvas allows you to write down your opportunities, risks, resources needed, and many other crucial aspects of your business. This helps you gain a clearer vision of what you should work on. This tool is great for building the practical side of your business. It’s also helpful for moving on from your concept to a materialized product of your vision. Another tool the author offers is the Value Proposition Canvas, which allows you to better analyze your customers.                                  Lesson 2: After designing your concept, it’s time to test it carefully At the end of the day, your business concept is an assumption. Although you may already see the bright future ahead, it’s always necessary to slow down and analyze everything objectively. As such, write down all assumptions that you made about your business. It can include a certain group of people that will buy from you, or that you’ll gain a given amount of money in a time frame.   Then, test these hypotheses to see if they’re true, and create an air-tight strategy that meets all alternatives. Test your assumptions by looking up information online, finding data on your market and concept, asking people in person about their opinions, or even finding someone who’s done something similar to you and learning from their experiences.  This part of the process is essential for building a successful plan that can stand the challenges of the business world. Make sure to create precise and specific hypotheses, so that you test accurate situations. Use numbers, names, and time frames to your assumptions. For example, you could test an assumption that sounds like this: “I will sell 10 products by the end of February.”                                            Lesson 3: Testing and experimenting with your assumptions can be done through discovery experiments The book presents two types of experiments that you can run to test your assumptions and see where you can improve them: discovery and validation experiments. With the first ones, you get to examine your concept and gain significant insights about it, thus determining if they’re right or wrong.   You can run discovery experiments by conducting customer interviews, for example. Start by creating a questionnaire or gathering a focus group. Then, prepare a series of questions to find out about their pain points and what they’d like to fix them. You can also observe your customers during their buying or consuming process, such as in a supermarket.  The point is to gather as much information as possible to conduct your research. Both weak and strong data can prove to be valuable, so make sure to use every resource in this process. After conducting interviews, asking friends or relatives for honest feedback, and looking at real-life data in shopping environments, it’s time to look up secondary data, or web reports and articles. You’ll be surprised by how many insights you’ll come across!",

          "Book-summary ": "1. Optimists see problems as temporary, pessimists as permanent. Sticking with the example from Mindset, if optimists  spill their coffee they won’t say “I always spill my coffee and ruin my clothes.”, but rather “I spilled my coffee this time, but I won’t spill the next one.”  2. Optimists see problems as specific to a situation, pessimists make them a general case. Being on a team assignment where one person doesn’t deliver their part, a pessimist is likely to say: “This team sucks.” and write off the entire team as lazy. An optimist would say: “One person is not very helpful, but I’m sure the rest of the team will do great work.”  3. Optimists see problems as externally caused, pessimists blame themselves. When getting a divorce, both people will think one of them is the major cause. An optimist will always attribute the failure to an external source, in this case, their former spouse (“He never wanted kids anyway”). The pessimist is likely to blame herself (“I never made time for her that’s why she left me).  Luckily, both styles are acquired and can be learned.               On the other hand, pessimism can likely be a cause of depression. Believing that nothing you do will change anything can of course make you depressed. A study where people had to press buttons to make noises stop found symptoms of depression in them whenever the experiment was rigged so that the buttons had no effect.  Optimism is also a deciding factor in professional sports. Seligman looked at baseball teams in 1985 and determined the New York Mets were the most optimistic team, the St. Luis Cardinals the most pessimistic. Guess who won the World Series one year later? The Mets.  Talent at work is just as overrated as talent in professional sports. The University of Pennsylvania usually assesses their freshmen according to their SATs, high school grades and achievement test. When they let Seligman segment the new students into optimists and pessimists, it turned out that the optimists exceeded expectations, where pessimists fell behind.  That same optimism will also carry you through a successful career, as Seligman’s study with Metropolitan shows. He hired people for them who underperformed skill-wise, but showed great optimism. The new employees outperformed even those with better skills.",

But the intervening years have seen extraordinary advances in the technology of observing both the micro- and the macrocosmic worlds.

          "Book-summary ": "Lesson 1: Theories can never be fully proven. As children we’re all scientists. We constantly come up with theories, and then test them. For example as a toddler you might have had the theory that a glass will easily survive its fall from the kitchen table  A theory, which you probably quickly went on to disprove, much to the frustration of your Mum and Dad.  Nowadays, since we’re grown up, we don’t see theories as what they are any more: educated guesses.  If you come up with the theory that your software startup needs 1,000 clients to thrive and start turning a profit, you almost instantly accept it as true, which leads to lots of disappointment, should you fail in spite of reaching that goal.  Hawking says a theory is nothing more than a model, which correctly explains a big number of observations.  This has 2 great benefits:  You can make definite predictions about the future. The theory can always be disproven, if evidence against it comes up. For example, a commonly accepted theory until 1903 was that nothing heavier than air could fly. That’s what kept 99% of people from driving their carriages over cliffs and jumping out of windows with wings attached to their back.  According to the theory, they wouldn’t be able to fly, and some of the people who tried added credibility to that theory.  However, on December 17th that year, Orville Wright stayed in the air for 12 seconds in the gasoline aircraft he and his brother had built. When he half crashed half landed after 120 feet in the air, the theory was disproven.  Hawking loves the fact that theories can always be proven wrong in the future, and so should you. Stop assuming so much, and start finding evidence!                           Lesson 2: Due to the constant speed of light, time is not fixed. If you’ve ever wondered what Einstein’s theory of relativity was all about, you’ve come to the right place.  The general statement of this theory is that the laws of physics are the same for all freely moving observers and objects.  Because the speed of light constantly being 186,000 miles per second is one such law, it means that no matter where you are or where you’re going, the speed with which light reaches you is the same.  However, time is always determined by dividing the distance something has traveled by its speed, right? For example if you take your car and drive for 100 miles at 100 mph, it will take you exactly an hour to get to your destination.  But if one person travels 186,000 miles towards a ray of light and another travels 186,000 miles away from it, but the speed of light is constant, the light would reach the first person 2 seconds faster – that is at a different point in time.  That’s the reason why time is relative and why Mr. Einstein has become so famous.                           Lesson 3: Time can most likely only move forward, for 3 reasons. Different times for different people is one thing, but how about time travel? Can time move backwards?  Hawking says it’s not impossible, but unlikely, for 3 reasons.  1. Time only moves forward thermodynamically.  Entropy is the tendency to increase disorder wherever possible.  For example your coffee mug only stays in mug form, because force is holding it together. As soon as you drop it, it’ll be happy to increase its entropy in the form of a whole bunch of shards. However, it would never spontaneously reassemble itself on its own (and thus decrease entropy), so thermodynamically, time only moves forward.  2. Time only moves forward psychologically.  You can never “remember” the future. For example after your mug breaks you can remember what it looked like before, but you can never know the exact position of the shards on the floor before you break it.  3. Time only moves forward cosmologically.  As the universe expands, its entropy increases. Since entropy constantly increasing also means that time moves forward, due to reason number 1, this adds to the point.  However, the universe could start contracting again, after reaching its maximum extension, thus reversing entropy and also time.  But Hawking says that we wouldn’t know: our bodies rely on entropy to break the food we eat down into its particles, which give us energy.  So if time were to ever start reversing, we’d have to die first.  But then again, who knows if that’ll ever happen, right?  After all, it’s just a theory.",

          "Book-summary ": "Lesson 1: Memory has become less and less important throughout history. We didn’t always have the attention span of a goldfish, but today it sure seems that way.  Imagine our memory had been so bad, once we finally became old enough to pass on knowledge from generation to generation.  We wouldn’t be here today, had the elders not remembered a few important things.  Before the invention of scripture, memory artists were today’s equivalent of quarterbacks. King Cyrus of Persia was known for knowing all the names of his soldiers, and Socrates mocked writing for making people forgetful.  No wonder: Anything that was written before 200 BC had no punctuation, all texts were basically just word strings. If you didn’t already know what you were reading, reading was useless.  If there’s one guy to blame then, for the decline of memory, we’d have to point the finger at Johannes Gutenberg. In 1440 he invented the printing press, and it was all downhill from there.  Once we could store information externally, physically store it anywhere in our house and access it at any time, the need to remember things significantly declined.  This tendency has continued ever since, and taken a major turn for the worse with the invention of smartphones and globally available internet.                    Lesson 2: However, our bad memory isn’t fixed. However, just because our memory sucks now doesn’t mean we can’t improve it. You might know that the average number of list items we can store in our short-term memory is 7.  This capacity can be extended though, as shown in a study by K. Anders Ericsson and William Chase from 1980.  Test subject S.F. expanded his ability to memorize digits from 7 to 79 through over 230 hours of repeating number sequences to himself, a technique also called the phonological loop.  Similarly, it was found that chess players have a so-called chess memory. Because they are an expert in their field, they perceive the board differently and focus on the most important parts of it, based on their experience.  It’s called chess memory because it is limited to chess and won’t help them do better on general memory tests.  The lesson? Through repetition, practice and becoming an expert in certain fields you can increase your capacity to remember things.                       Lesson 3: Chunking and the memory palace are 2 great techniques to instantly improve your memory. Remembering more is one thing, and you’re bound to hit an eventual ceiling there, but recalling better and faster is where it really gets interesting.  2 quick examples from the summary are chunking and the memory palace. Chunking simply means dividing one string of information into several.  Can you remember 1117200112241999 just by looking at it once?  Neither can I, but I can remember 2 dates in a row: 11/17/2001 and 12/24/1999.  Fascinating, right? By creating 2 chunks of differently formatted information, memorizing a string of seemingly random numbers becomes easy.  If you now put these dates into context, it’ll be even easier, for example 11/17/2001 was my friend’s 11th birthday and the second date was Christmas 1999.  The memory palace is a technique where you walk along a route you know really well, and put memories in certain locations along the way.  For example, you could go through your childhood home and place the items from your shopping list on the kitchen table. Then, when you’re in the grocery store, all you have to do is to mentally enter the kitchen and see what’s there.  Once you see tomatoes, onions and potatoes on the table, you know what to shop for. You can even have multiple routes for different kinds of memories.",

          "Book-description ": "After years of watching her students struggling with their choices, health psychologist Kelly McGonigal, Ph.D., realized that much of what people believe about willpower is actually sabotaging their success. Committed to sharing what the scientific community already knew about self-control, McGonigal created a course called \"The Science of Willpower\" for Stanford University's Continuing Studies Program. The course was an instant hit and spawned the hugely successful Psychology Today blog with the same name.  Informed by the latest research and combining cutting-edge insights from psychology, economics, neuroscience, and medicine, McGonigal's book explains exactly what willpower is, how it works, and why it matters. Readers will learn:  Willpower is a mind-body response, not a virtue. It is a biological function that can be improved through mindfulness, exercise, nutrition, and sleep. People who have better control of their attention, emotions, and actions are healthier, happier, have more satisfying relationships, and make more money. Willpower is not an unlimited resource. Too much self-control can actually be bad for your health. Temptation and stress hijack the brain's systems of self-control, and that the brain can be trained for greater willpower.  In the groundbreaking tradition of Getting Things Done, The Willpower Instinct combines life-changing prescriptive advice and complementary exercises to help readers with goals ranging from a healthier life to more patient parenting, from greater productivity at work to finally finishing the basement.",

          "Book-summary ": "Lesson 1: There are 3 kinds of willpower. Most people think of willpower as the ability to resist temptations. However, that’s only one third of the deal. McGonigal puts willpower into 3 distinct categories:  “I won’t” power “I will” power “I want” power “I won’t” power is the willpower you already know: It’s what you use when you resist that cookie on the conference table, the urge to watch the next episode of Breaking Bad, or to swing by McDonald’s on your way home.  Question to ask yourself: Which habit is hurting my health, happiness, and career the most? This will help you determine what you need to use your “I won’t” power the most for.  Second, there’s “I will” power, the force that helps you do what’s uncomfortable, but important to reach your goals. This is the kind of willpower that allows you to delay gratification now, so you can reap the rewards later.  Question to ask yourself: Which habit should I do every day to reach my goals?  Lastly, there’s “I want” power, the force that allows you to remember your long-term goals when you most need to, i.e. in situations where you need your “I will” power.  Question to ask yourself: What is my one goal that I want to spend a lot more of my time on?  Out of these 3, “I want” power is by far the most powerful. It is not so much about the goal itself, but more about having a strong reason and a clear why for delaying gratification now to succeed in the long term.                          Lesson 2: The pause-and-plan response is your biological willpower instinct. Have you ever felt followed by someone and wanted to just run home as quickly as possible?  That’s your fight-or-flight response, and it’s triggered by stress, for example in dangerous situations, or in our modern world, being afraid to miss a deadline.  Kelly McGonigal says there’s an alternate version of this though: the pause-and-plan response. This is a state that can be triggered when you’re facing a willpower challenge and will boost your willpower in that particular moment.  Instead of heightening your senses and releasing adrenaline, like in the fight-or-flight state, this response allows you to pause and reflect, by shifting your attention to your inner conflict. It gives you that short time buffer you need to make the better decision.  This is your biological willpower instinct, and like your gut, it can be trained. However, since willpower is like a muscle, it does get exhausted over time. This is why your decisions get worse later in the day. Some ways to stock up your willpower to the maximum are:  Eating healthy food, especially low-glycemic foods. Meditating for as little as 11 hours over several sessions. Exercising regularly. Getting a good night of quality sleep – every night. Spending time with someone who has strong willpower.                              Lesson 3: Past good behavior can’t be an excuse for present bad behavior. Let’s say you’re trying to quit alcohol and you do incredibly well all week. You resist the temptation to go to a bar with coworkers on Wednesday, you get through your gym workout the day after, and are highly motivated to lose those extra pounds.  So on Sunday, what do you do?  You reward yourself with a beer, because you’ve done so well.  This is the worst thing you could do.  Note: Speaking of beer, my friends Ruari and Andy are causing some riot in the UK with their One Year No Beer challenge. Some of us coach.me coaches are helping out, it’s a great way to see if you want to quit the booze.  Giving yourself a reward that drives you away from your long-term goal is counter-productive and not a good strategy to win. As your reward for taking 7 steps forward, you’re taking 1 step back.  The message is to be aware of your attitude, because when you do well, you get lazy.  That doesn’t mean you can’t be proud of your accomplishments, but don’t use your past successes as an excuse to fail today.",

          "Book-summary ": "Lesson 1: Pleasure and enjoyment are not the same thing. This is a really cool differentiation. Pleasure is what most people nowadays confuse with happiness. It comes from sensory experiences, like eating a pizza, getting a massage, or having sex and takes away your control of your attention.  When you’re busy munching on a tasty slice of chicken supreme, you can’t really control what you pay attention too, because all of it is taken up by your sense of taste.  Enjoyment, on the other hand, comes from concentrating and consciously focusing, which gives you back your control over your attention.  This is where true happiness lies, as enjoyment allows you to work towards your most important goals and to go beyond the limitations of your genes.  Many people opt for pleasure instead of enjoyment, which the world makes easy, as we seem to live in instant gratification-land now, which is also why many people are so miserable.  But how can you find enjoyment? By trying to spend a lot of time in flow.                     Lesson 2: Flow is the state where challenges and skills match, so that time flies by. Flow is what’s behind every good video game. It is the state where you are so immersed in the activity you’re doing, that you’re completely forgetting about all your worries and anxieties, and you look up after hours, wondering where time went.  How can you trigger it?  2 things:  Pick an activity you find rewarding, something that’s meaningful to you, without any external incentive (like money or fame). Make sure the challenge of the activity matches your skill level. The first part is straight forward. It means you should have fun. Plant a tree, draw a comic, write an article about the Minions, whatever you think is meaningful to you.  There can’t be any money involved. Don’t do it for fame, wealth, or even religion. Just because you think it’s awesome.  Part 2 is a bit harder. Flow is triggered when the challenge isn’t so hard you’ll get frustrated, while your skills aren’t so good already that you get bored.  It’s right in between.  If you decide to pick up chess, play on an easy setting against your computer first. Then, get a friend to play against you who’s slightly better than you. Once you consistently beat her, you can move to the next level.  Basically, flow is where your life feels like the perfect game: you just want to keep on going and going and going.  So make some time for your hobbies or take up a fun project – you never know what the skills might be good for.                      Lesson 3: Life goals are irrelevant, so set a life goal. I love this. The summary says you can create your own meaning of life. To do so, you simply have to set an ultimate goal for your life.  Here’s the best part: It doesn’t matter what that goal is, as long as it keeps getting you into flow without caring what other people think.  This is the best thing a book could tell you.  It’s all you want to hear.  Go set some crazy goal and tell others to get lost if they tell you it’s stupid. If it keeps you challenged so your skills keep growing and gets more complex as you go along, you’re golden.  This is exactly what I’m doing with Four Minute Books. I make sure I read and write every day, no matter if no one reads it. I do share it, so people can benefit, but I’m doing it for the sake of itself.  I have a hunch that the more you do of that, the more successful you’ll be.",

AI will be the defining issue of the twenty-first century, but many people know little about it apart from visions of dystopian robots or flying cars. Though the term has been around for half a century, it is only now, Kai-Fu Lee argues, that AI is poised to upend our society, just as the arrival of technologies like electricity and smart phones did before it. In the past five years, AI has shown it can learn games like chess in mere hours--and beat humans every time. AI has surpassed humans in speech and object recognition, even outperforming radiologists in diagnosing lung cancer. AI is at a tipping point. What comes next?  Within two decades, aspects of daily life may be unrecognizable. Humankind needs to wake up to AI, both its pathways and perils. In this provocative work that juxtaposes speculative storytelling and science, Lee, one of the world's leading AI experts, has teamed up with celebrated novelist Chen Qiufan to reveal how AI will trickle down into every aspect of our world by 2041. In ten gripping narratives that crisscross the globe, coupled with incisive analysis, Lee and Chen explore AI's challenges and its potential:  - Ubiquitous AI that knows you better than you know yourself - Genetic fortune-telling that predicts risk of disease or even IQ - AI sensors that creates a fully contactless society in a future pandemic - Immersive personalized entertainment to challenge our notion of celebrity - Quantum computing and other leaps that both eliminate and increase risk  By gazing toward a not-so-distant horizon, AI 2041 offers powerful insights and compelling storytelling for everyone interested in our collective future.",

          "Book-summary ": "Lesson 1: With AI, people can now create deepfakes extremely close to reality There is no doubt that AI can help us achieve great things. For example, Google Translate helps millions of users every day to understand foreign languages. Also, AI systems in hospitals can centralize data and help spot and treat diseases using common patterns.   However, harnessing the power of AI can prove to be a challenging feat. In the wrong hands, such powerful technology can be destructive. Take Buzzfeed’s video of Barack Obama calling Donald Trump a “total dipshit” in 2018. The only problem? The video was a deepfake created with the help of AI to shed some light on its potential harm of it.   Therefore, you always have to be skeptical regarding what you see online. However, there are still ways to spot and prove a fake from the original, if the situation asks for it. Computers are not sufficiently advanced to make sense of images like the human brain does, but with enough data, AI systems won’t take too long until they can fake any image, video, or online piece of content.                         Lesson 2: AI has the potential to help people learn better and easier Artificial intelligence can prove to be a leveraging tool in the learning process. Moreover, it can help children become more communicative and increase their engagement with the world. Let’s say a child has a hard time integrating into class and can’t make friends easily. On top of that, they don’t feel comfortable speaking their mind and being around other kids.   Given a magic pair of glasses, the kid can now see a funny-looking, fictional character that speaks to him, and thanks to the available information and biometric data, it seems that the character knows all about them. To the kid’s surprise, this persona seems to understand them like no one else and they become best friends. Now, the AI can dictate the course of this friendship and help the kid become more sociable, and encourage them to speak their mind.  Another way through which AI can help people is by accelerating learning processes. AI-derived educational software systems can help teachers grade papers, assign tasks, answer questions about lectures while leaving more time for professors to engage with students. While AI can’t teach emotional intelligence and human interactions, it can definitely help reduce the burden of repetitive tasks.                        Lesson 3: Augmented reality, mixed reality, and extreme reality will become a common go-to place for people Augmented reality is taking over the world. With just a pair of glasses and the help of highly-advanced software that can replicate the real world and add certain extra elements, people can now have out-of-the-ordinary experiences.   In the extra reality, people get to feel and experience almost anything, from day-to-day activities like a meeting to paranormal experiences like seeing ghosts, talking to fictional characters from movies, and so on. All it takes is a tailored questionnaire to be able to feed the machine your data and the experience of a lifetime is waiting behind a pair of VR glasses.   These virtual worlds work extremely well on people because they deliver customized experiences for the user and show them familiar items from their actual life. Still, the technology is yet to be fully developed, but with the help of AI, these machines will be able to reproduce, augment, and create experiences for their users that are better than their actual lives. In some cases, there are people who already prefer their VR glasses and video games to the live interactions.",

Remember how 2 days ago you learned that women taking up careers post World War II lead to the rise of processed food?  It’s the same reason that lead to the creation of the American dream: the house with the white picket fence, 2 kids, 2 nice cars in the garage and a big vacation every year.  Both parents working meant more income, which made this lavish lifestyle affordable, which is when the idea that a perfect life is mostly based on consumption became the ideal standard that we started chasing.  The plan was clear: get a good education, get a safe job, work hard, hopefully be promoted and thus able to keep up your expensive lifestyle until you retire.  But in 2008 the American dream bubble abruptly burst. The world’s biggest financial crisis lead to companies ruthlessly cutting costs – mostly in the form of people.  Almost everything can now either be outsourced or done by technology, which is why thousands of college graduates now find themselves unemployed or underpaid – the end of jobs is here.  But what should you do if your fancy college degree now only gets you a job at McDonalds? Is it all bad? No. Here’s what to do.                        Lesson 2: You have to make yourself the only person who controls your dreams. I can’t believe I couldn’t remember where I read this, I wrote a whole article about this sentence, after all. I’m texting myself this very sentence every morning, for Pete’s sake 😀  But now I do.  You have to make yourself the only person who controls your dreams.  This one sentence contains everything you need to know about choosing yourself.  If financial freedom is your dream, then you have to control your income, which means creating products, freelancing, making passive income from affiliate marketing, selling books, courses, teaching seminars – do any one, or even better, all of these.  Want to make your own hours? Then you have to control your time (which leads to the same conclusion).  Why aren’t you the only one who controls your dreams already? Because you’re afraid.  That’s okay. We all are.  Afraid of what our family will think if we leave our “stable job”.  Afraid of what friends might say.  Afraid of our customers rejecting us.  Avoiding rejection is a powerful motivator. But it makes us miserable.  As long as you choose to live with that fear, instead of acting in spite of it, you are giving others the power to make your choices for you.  Remember this, and carry it with you as you make your first steps: You have to make yourself the only person who controls your dreams.                     Lesson 3: You can choose yourself by beginning a daily practice of good habits in 4 areas. Now you know why you have to choose yourself and what that looks like, but where do you even begin? James suggests a very simple daily practice, focusing on taking care of yourself in 4 areas.  Mental health Physical health Emotional health Spiritual health James tries to improve himself by just 1% in all of these areas every single day. For him, that means sleeping well, eating well, exercising a bit, (a long walk is just fine) and writing down 10 ideas a day, no matter if they’re good or bad.  A daily practice can also mean only being around people you love while cutting the toxic ones out of your lie. Or, to practice gratitude so you can live in the moment each day and not time travel to the past or future in your head. For seven years now, I have written down three things I’m grateful for each night, and it has changed my life like few other habits.  The strength to choose yourself comes from within. James’s daily practice gives you that strength. He even created a free website where you can track your daily practice. You can also use an app like coach.me.",

          "Book-summary ": "Lesson 1: Scientists have found a way to utilize the natural phenomenon of CRISPR that happens in bacteria. The acronym CRISPR stands for clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats. Sounds complex, right?  Think of it more simply as a part of bacterial DNA that lets us cut and modify genes as we please.  To understand how this all works, you need to know about three parts that allow these bacteria to cut through virus DNA to fight it:  CRISPR-associated, or CAS gene, specifically the Cas9 gene CRISPR RNA tracrRNA Each of these three components has an important role in what bacteria does to modify DNA. The Cas9 gene lets the bacteria cut through virus DNA to disable its effects. It knows where to slice because CRISPR RNA acts as a messenger to tell Cas9 where to go make the snip. Last we have tracrRNA, which turns on the cutting action.  So we know that this happens naturally in our world, all around us, all the time. The next question researchers asked was whether they could use CRISPR to cut specific DNA in a lab. And it turns out this is possible.  When CRISPR makes it’s slice, there’s a space right afterward that the body begins to repair itself. Utilizing that opportunity, scientists can insert whatever DNA sequence they want to, which modifies the traits of the organism. Thus, we can change whatever we desire to be different about our genes. This can upgrade many aspects of our lives as we’re about to see.                   Lesson 2: We can use gene editing to grow healthier crops and eliminate some diseases. Let’s take a look at some of the practical applications of this tool. The ability to modify genes gives us a chance to create crops that produce more, resist sickness, and are healthier.   The citrus industry, for example, has a problem with what’s called yellow dragon disease. Utilizing gene editing, we could end the decimation of plantations in Asia that this plague causes. We can also modify our food to be better for us, like taking trans fats out of soybean oil for example.   Some pigs in Canada have already been genetically modified to have better digestion. This reduces phosphorus in their waste that causes algal blooms that kill aquatic animals.   For humans, we’ve got over 7,000 diseases that result from a single gene mutation each. All of these could be gone with CRISPR. Even HIV, which affects millions around the world, may be preventable with gene editing. It could also find a cure for fatal diseases like muscular dystrophy.   This amazing new tool even has a chance at stopping cancer entirely. Because DNA mutations cause cancer, the ability to cut and modify DNA at will might be able to stop it. All of this sounds amazing, but there are some roadblocks to this nearly sickness-free world you’re imagining.                          Lesson 3: Although this new breakthrough sounds all good, we must answer some questions and ethical implications about it. The author’s breakthrough research was going well in 2014 when an entrepreneur had an interesting pitch to co-author Samuel Sternberg. They wanted him to help create a “CRISPR baby.” Sternberg declined this offer, but this began a string of ethical questions about gene editing that we still need to answer.  Is it ethically okay to use something like this to choose a baby’s gender or modify it to be stronger or prettier? Concerns began to arise in the author’s mind about someone abusing CRISPR. It got so bad at one point that she once had a dream that she met Adolf Hitler, who asked about the process. The thought of a psychopath like him getting this technology terrified Doudna.   Doudna suggests reviewing three themes as we figure out the next steps of gene editing technology. The first is safety, which she feels will soon be taken care of as the science of CRISPR advances. Next is the ethical component. While eliminating diseases is amazing, some might wonder why we should stop there. It may not be long before unregulated gene editing allows people, mostly the rich, to buy better bodies for themselves.   Which brings us to her last point of the regulations that governments must make. This has already begun with an International Summit on Human Gene Editing back in 2015. We can only hope that meetings like this one will continue to progress efforts to enforce limits. I for one hope that we will soon see a time when we can use CRISPR to make a better world for all of us.",

          "Book-description ": "It is worse, much worse, than you think. If your anxiety about global warming is dominated by fears of sea-level rise, you are barely scratching the surface of what terrors are possible. In California, wildfires now rage year-round, destroying thousands of homes. Across the US, \"500-year\" storms pummel communities month after month, and floods displace tens of millions annually.  This is only a preview of the changes to come. And they are coming fast. Without a revolution in how billions of humans conduct their lives, parts of the Earth could become close to uninhabitable, and other parts horrifically inhospitable, as soon as the end of this century.  In his travelogue of our near future, David Wallace-Wells brings into stark relief the climate troubles that await--food shortages, refugee emergencies, and other crises that will reshape the globe. But the world will be remade by warming in more profound ways as well, transforming our politics, our culture, our relationship to technology, and our sense of history. It will be all-encompassing, shaping and distorting nearly every aspect of human life as it is lived today.  Like An Inconvenient Truth and Silent Spring before it, The Uninhabitable Earth is both a meditation on the devastation we have brought upon ourselves and an impassioned call to action. For just as the world was brought to the brink of catastrophe within the span of a lifetime, the responsibility to avoid it now belongs to a single generation.",

          "Book-summary ": "Lesson 1: The Paris climate agreement goals are hopelessly optimistic and too little, too late. There was an epic meeting of the world leaders in Paris about 4 years ago. These leaders working towards an agreement were trying to set new goals to tackle the mounting threat of climate change. Finally, politicians are recognizing the serious implications and urgency that can occur from this situation.  From these talks stemmed the objective of maintaining global average temperatures below 2 degrees Celsius higher than pre-industrial levels. This figure was chosen because it is the temperature threshold at which disaster begins. The problem is that we are going to exceed this 2-degree threshold, and by a good measure.   The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released a report in 2018. The data indicates that even if the world governments take aggressive actions now, by enacting all proposed policies agreed to in the Paris talks, we will still continue to see global temperatures rise in excess of 3.2 degrees before warning halts. This is not good news.  What this means is that the world’s ice sheets will still collapse in our lifetime. This would lead to the eventual flooding of hundreds of cities, including Miami, Shanghai, and Hong Kong. Southern Europe would experience permanent drought and wildfires in the U.S would increase 600 percent. And this is the optimistic scenario.                          Lesson 2: Atlantis might not be such a myth for long with major cities underwater as a consequence of climate change. The best-known consequence of climate change is melting polar ice caps. This will cause a rise in sea levels. Without curbing our emissions output this can translate into ocean rises between 1.2 and 2.4 meters within the next century.   To give you some idea of the impact of this, the city of Bangladesh, which has a population of 164 million people would be completely submerged. Other locations that would suffer a similar catastrophe, outside of all of the world’s most beautiful beaches, are Saint Mark’s Basilica in Venice, California’s Silicon Valley area, and Washington, D.C. At the current rate we are going, the Indonesian megacity, Jakarta will be entirely underwater by the year 2050.  Dare we look further down the road? If we peak ahead as far as 2100, projections show things will become increasingly worse if we fail to reduce emissions now. The result will be oceans rising up to 6 meters higher in the coming centuries.   Imagine the disappearance of ports, energy plants, military bases, farmlands along with major cities. Asia would experience the most severe devastation with cities like Shanghai, Mumbai, and Kolkata underwater.   It’s estimated that the average American emits enough carbon to melt 10,000 tons of Antarctic ice. To provide some additional perspective on this, if Americans adopted the same carbon footprint of their European counterparts, a continent not known for environmentally-friendly lifestyles themselves – America’s emissions would be cut in half.                              Lesson 3: We might be on the verge of a global health crisis as old diseases are revived and current ones rejuvenated. It’s unsettling to think that all the progress in medical science over the centuries could be gone in a single generation. And it would all be due to climate change. It’s possible that this global health crisis would manifest in two ways: old diseases revived and current ones rejuvenated.   The bacteria of ancient diseases are currently trapped in our Arctic ice sheets. Some of these bacteria have been extinct for millions of years. Since some have been around longer than humans have walked the earth, our immune systems would have no immunity to fight them off. And the diseases that we are familiar with, such as bubonic plague or smallpox would also be unleashed on us.  Many diseases thrive in hot, humid weather conditions, from salmonella developing in spoiling meat, to summer outbreaks of cholera, even in the developing regions of the world.    As warming accelerates, the earth’s tropic zones will expand. This will lead to more countries that will be perfectly suited to host malaria and the mosquitos which transmit it will have an ideal breeding ground.   ",

          "Book-summary ": "The first is to constantly work on your creative thinking skills. As opposed to just memorizing facts, which will only help you in certain situations, creative thinking will help you solve any kind of problem you will face.  Your brain can assess and adapt to any situation, because it stays flexible.  David suggests 3 things:  Always be open to new ideas. Learn something new whenever you can. Ask yourself “How can I do a better job today?” every day. For example: It might seem useless to you to learn photoshop if you’re working in a car dealership, but if it’s fun, do it anyway. Adopt the mentality of “Who knows what it might be good for?“. In this case you could easily use your new graphic design skills to create a bunch of awesome Facebook ads that can help you sell a lot more cars.  The second strategy is to shut down the negative voices in your head. With the news reporting mostly on horrifying events and everyone around you only complaining, negative thinking is quite the norm. However, you’ll find nay-sayers are almost always unsuccessful or just average.  You can do this by writing down a pep talk that reads like a commercial where you try to sell yourself to yourself. Focus on what makes you different, for example that you’re funny and make people laugh at work all the time. Read it out loud once a day and in quiet whenever you feel a bit down.  Chances are you won’t become a success all on your own – usually people around us lift us up in a way. That’s why you should treat everyone you meet with respect. Even if they act crazy, they might just have a bad day. But just like you want to be treated like an important person, so do they.  Note: The author suggests to treat everyone like they can make or break your career. Thinking that way causes me anxiety, so I rather adopt Kid President’s philosophy: Treat everyone like it’s their birthday, even if they don’t deserve it.  The next piece of advice regards your peers. You’ve probably heard the saying “You are the average of the five people you surround yourself with.” And while you can’t change the people around you, you can change the people around you.  So be sure to create an environment of high quality people for yourself and only take advice from the ones that have gone where you want to go.  Note: Jeff Bezos from Amazon didn’t have a lot of successful friends, so he just surrounded himself with books. By reading biographies of successful people he felt like hanging out with them.  Another important factor is your attitude, which will be reflected in the way you walk, talk and behave. Attitudes are mirrors of the mind and people always catch on to what’s going on. After all, reading body language has been how we survived for thousands of years.  Two things you can do to improve your attitude include always doing what you think is morally right and always dressing well. The former is powerful from the inside, because you believing in your work will make sure you take pride in it, the latter is powerful from the outside, because it makes you and others feel important.  No one is born confident, yet everyone can learn it. “Fake it till you make it” is true in this case, because you can control your emotions by behaving the way you want to feel. So sit in the first row, make eye contact with people and walk faster than others.",

          "Book-summary ": "Lesson 1: The three tools of winners are strategy, objectives and tactics. Alastair Campbell, the author of this book, has picked out three things that all winners have in hand at all times:  A realistic objective. A solid strategy. A set of tactics. The objective is your goal. The tournament you want to win, the amount of weight you want to lose, the monthly income you want to make. It’s important that this objective is both specific and realistic. Don’t say you want to “get thinner,” say you want to “lose 15 pounds.” But not 50. Only having a realistic objective will allow you to pick a good strategy for it.  The strategy is the long-term “how” of winning. You can’t change your strategy from one day to the next, or it becomes useless. For example, if you want to exercise more and eat less, decide to stick to that mantra for the next six months. Don’t switch to sleeping more or other strategies after a week.  Lastly, subordinate to a strategy are the tactics you pick to implement your strategy. For example for exercising more, you could create a gym schedule that includes three 1-hour sessions every week and for eating less you could cap your calories at 2,000 every day. Those tactics are the small steps you take every day and week and are subject to change a lot.  As long as a tactic works for implementing your strategy in a way that gets you closer to your objective, keep doing it. But once it stops, drop it and try the next one, without changing the strategy.                       Lesson 2: Winners are so terrified of losing that they’re happy to get uncomfortable to avoid it. Most people spend most of their lives in this preliminary stage of wanting. They say they want something, but they really just want to want it. What does this mean?  It means they desire it enough to claim they want it, but they don’t want it bad enough that it hurts not to work for it. For them, the pain of doing it is still bigger than the pain of not doing it.  To become a winner, you have to reach and cross this threshold of pain. In the summer of 2000, Michael Phelps was ready to compete in the Olympics. He felt ready in every way. Physically, mentally, emotionally. He even got on the team, but only started in the 200 m butterfly category, where he ended up fifth.  Having missed his only shot at an Olympic medal thus far, he was terrified of not being given the chance to try again. He could not stand the thought of losing, so he went back and worked even harder than before, winning eight medals (six gold, two bronze) at the next summer Olympics in 2004.  If you still feel like you’re too comfortable, like life just feels too much like you’re winning already and that losing isn’t a threat, get yourself under pressure.  Ditch that comfort zone of yours, think of your next, big, potential loss, and let that drive you to take action!                                  Lesson 3: When a crisis happens, winners block out everything they can’t control. We use the word “crisis” too liberally. When your hair won’t look the part, that’s not a crisis. Neither is Trump calling Hillary “the devil,” or when your favorite pizza place doesn’t deliver after 10 PM.  But when a US president sleeps with one of his interns, that’s a crisis. The difference between a fake crisis, and a real crisis, like this one, is that a real crisis can bring you to rock bottom, if you get overwhelmed by it and make the wrong decisions.  So how do you call the right shots in times like this? You block out everything that’s out of your control and focus on the few things you can actually influence. In doing so, you’re taking a Stoic approach to things, and that’s exactly what Clinton did.  He had no control over the media or the reactions of the public when his affair was publicized, but he could keep doing his job, for example by keeping up conversations with Tony Blair about the Russian nuclear arm situation. Clinton still ended up getting impeached at the very end, but he still managed the situation as best as he could.  When shit hits the fan, don’t try to control where it flies. Turn off the fan and start wiping.",

          "Book-description ": "Benjamin Franklin is the Founding Father who winks at us. An ambitious urban entrepreneur who rose up the social ladder, from leather-aproned shopkeeper to dining with kings, he seems made of flesh rather than of marble. In bestselling author Walter Isaacson's vivid and witty full-scale biography, we discover why Franklin seems to turn to us from history's stage with eyes that twinkle from behind his new-fangled spectacles. By bringing Franklin to life, Isaacson shows how he helped to define both his own time and ours.  He was, during his 84-year life, America's best scientist, inventor, diplomat, writer, and business strategist, and he was also one of its most practical—though not most profound—political thinkers. He proved by flying a kite that lightning was electricity, and he invented a rod to tame it. He sought practical ways to make stoves less smoky and commonwealths less corrupt. He organized neighborhood constabularies and international alliances, local lending libraries and national legislatures. He combined two types of lenses to create bifocals and two concepts of representation to foster the nation's federal compromise. He was the only man who shaped all the founding documents of America: the Albany Plan of Union, the Declaration of Independence, the treaty of alliance with France, the peace treaty with England, and the Constitution. And he helped invent America's unique style of homespun humor, democratic values, and philosophical pragmatism.  But the most interesting thing that Franklin invented, and continually reinvented, was himself. America's first great publicist, he was, in his life and in his writings, consciously trying to create a new American archetype. In the process, he carefully crafted his own persona, portrayed it in public, and polished it for posterity.  Through it all, he trusted the hearts and minds of his fellow \"leather-aprons\" more than he did those of any inbred elite. He saw middle-class values as a source of social strength, not as something to be derided. His guiding principle was a \"dislike of everything that tended to debase the spirit of the common people.\" Few of his fellow founders felt this comfort with democracy so fully, and none so intuitively.",

          "Book-summary ": "Lesson 1: Above all, Benjamin Franklin embraced learning. He was a true self-improvement nerd. Ben Franklin started learning early. At just ten years old, he took his first apprenticeship and worked ever since. So by the time he took a job with printer Samuel Keimer at age 17, he’d been learning for seven years already.  But picking an industry and committing to learning the tools of the trade is just one part of the equation. He was also hell bent on improving personally, a trait which, I think, has allowed him to confidently switch topics.  Having taken the job to further improve his writing skills, he eventually ended up staying because of the long, philosophical discussions he had with Samuel (which had a great influence on his later debating and speaking ability). To integrate learning into every single day, he even created a 5-hour rule for himself, spending one hour each weekday on reading, writing, setting goals, coming up with ideas, talking with like-minded people and reflecting.  One of the books that most impacted him is called The Pilgrim’s Progress, a religious story outlining the Christian journey in the form of a dream.  You could say that Benjamin Franklin was one of the first self-improvement nerds, loving to learn and obsessing about making consistent progress with his life, just like you and me 🙂                                     Lesson 2: If it was possible in the 1700s, it’s possible in 2016. If you really want to learn something, you’ll find a way. For all his success in business, what Ben Franklin really wanted to do was write. That’s why he took an apprenticeship with a printer in the first place. He also worked at the New England Courant, the first, independent Boston newspaper, which belonged to his brother.  Of course the only way to get better at writing is to get feedback for it, so he was eager to publish some of his essays in the newspaper, but since he was 17 years old, nobody would’ve taken him seriously. So instead, he created a female alter ego, Mrs. Silence Dogood, in whose name he published his funny first attempts at writing.  Sure, having access to a newspaper isn’t something everyone can count on, but if Ben Franklin found a way to really learn how to write in 1721, so can you in 2016. Even better, today, you can publish almost anything online, free for the world to see – whether that’s a video, a song or something you’ve written.  “I don’t have a publisher/agent/film school education” aren’t valid excuses any more. If you really want to learn, you’ll find a way. If not, you’ll find an excuse.                             Lesson 3: Don’t let being ahead of your time get to you. Embrace it and be patient. No matter what you want to learn and eventually be successful in, it’s always going to entail some kind of risk, whether it means putting all of your money into a new technology, sticking with your opinion, even if it’s unpopular, or pursuing something that other people tell you will never work.  This means you’ll often feel like you know something to be true and the world simply hasn’t caught up yet. It’s easy to get discouraged when you feel you’re the only one who’s ahead of the curve, frustrating even and maybe you’ll want to give up. As long as you think you’re right – don’t.  Benjamin Franklin was at least 20, sometimes dozens of years ahead of his time, but he still knew that eventually, people would come around.  For example he not only discovered electricity with his favorite key-on-a-kite-experiment, he was also the first to store electricity from a lightning strike in a so-called Leyden jar, some of which he connected and called a “battery.” A battery! In the 1750s!  He also already lined out a government model for the united colonies that would later become the USA in the 1750s, 20 years before the actual declaration of independence.  Until the very end, he kept up his visionary thinking, putting forward a petition in 1790, the year he died, stating the US government had to “uphold the liberty of the American people, without distinction of color” – he wanted to abolish slavery – something that would actually happen 75 years later.",

          "Book-summary ": "Lesson 1: Customers have a lot more power than they used to, so you should act accordingly and respect them. Here’s how I bought my last TV (which was six years ago, btw, I don’t own one any more): I went into the local electronics store, looked at a few models live and how much I liked the color, design, etc. After I found one that I liked, I took out my smartphone and googled the model name. I saw a price range on a comparison site, looked at the tag of the TV in the store, and instantly realized that there was a difference of at least 10%. I went home, browsed around some more and ordered it online for 25% less than it cost in the store.  Whether you like it or not, that’s just how consumption works today. Nobody in their right mind wouldn’t use this power of all the product information, pricing ranges and online reviews they could ever need, especially when all you have to do is to reach into your pocket.  We go, we look, we compare, we browse…and we buy where it’s cheapest (usually Amazon).  Even back in the 60s, David Ogilvy said “the consumer isn’t a moron,” and it’s just gotten truer since then.  For example, if you sell swimming goggles, telling every customer, who enters your store, that you sell “the cheapest goggles around” is useless – they can verify (or falsify) that information within seconds.  However, if you use the same data to your advantage, for example by finding your customer’s Facebook likes and sending them an ad for a coupon for a specific pair of goggles they’ve showed interest in, then you respect their power and preferences, which changes everything.                     Lesson 2: People want to use products more than they want to own them, especially millennials. Another mega-trend that changes consumer behavior in a big way is the sharing economy. Especially people from the millennial generation (like me), care a lot more about having the lifestyle certain products allow than actually owning them.  For example, being able to go from A to B quickly and independently used to mean you have to own a car. Now you can use public transport or a car-sharing service like Uber in a lot of places and have the exact same benefits, without the hassles that come with owning a car, like insurance, maintenance, parking, etc.  This trend is happening because of two things:  Millennials know that they’re the first generation that’ll likely have worse job prospects than their parents. Young people are overwhelmed by the consumption culture and less prone to it. On the other hand, middle class consumption is on the rise in Asian countries, as they can slowly afford more and more and want to reach the levels Western cultures already hit 10-20 years ago.  These things are important to keep in mind when designing your products and services – if they don’t fit your target customers’ mindsets, selling will get really, really tough.                     Lesson 3: At the heart of all businesses needs to be a great customer experience. I love John Sculley’s answer to the question “What’s the most important element in any successful business?” I’m really glad he chose his words the way he did.  In his eyes, it’s all about the customer experience.  Why? Mainly, because it costs 10 to 15 times more to replace profits from a customer you’ve lost by acquiring a new one, than to just keep your previous customers’ profits by keeping them happy.  If you have just one customer, it’s your job to go above and beyond for that single person. That’s what creates trust and trust is what scales a business.  You can do that by using any first purchase an individual makes as a launch pad into a great customer experience. If people order food from you, you keep them up to date during the delivery process, personally greet them when you deliver, follow up with them a day later on how much they liked the food, and ask them what other dishes they’d like to see from you after a week, for example.  Make them feel taken care of at every step of the way.  What makes your customer experience amazing could be a variety of different things, some of the most popular ones are:  Super cheap prices (that’s a rather lame one and hard to pull off) Very fast delivery (Amazon, anyone?) Making them feel special (the hardest one, but the best one if you can pull it off, Apple, BMW & Virgin do great at this)",

          "Book-summary ": "Lesson 1: Use whatever industry’s available to you as leverage for the one you really want to break into. Even though you might think the name sounds aristocratic, the Rothschilds weren’t always rich. Far from it, the head of the family, Mayer Amschel Rothschild lived, like all Jews, in a ghetto in Frankfurt, Germany, with very few narrow streets, in the 1750s. The family name is simply derived from the house they inhabited, which was marked with a red shield.  It wasn’t a particularly great time for Jews, as they weren’t allowed to live outside Jews’ Lane (Judengasse), stay overnight elsewhere, use parks, inns, coffee houses or even walk along the promenade.  However, what they were allowed to do is trade. Hence, Mayer built a business buying and selling antiques. He knew how to handle money and turn a profit, so he kept leveraging smaller items into bigger, rarer ones, and thus eventually grew into Frankfurt’s leading antique dealer.  And do you know what antique dealer’s also deal with, except old chairs and lamps? Coins. Knowing a lot about currency and exchange rate, banking was a logical next step and soon Mayer extended his business to banking, scoring a few prominent clients and gaining the trust of even the Crown Prince Wilhelm of Hesse.  Instead of thinking inside his own limitations, Mayer picked an industry adjacent to the one he wanted to get into, in which he could win, and leveraged it into bigger things.                             Lesson 2: If the best solution that’s currently available still isn’t good enough, build your own instead. By the time Mayer died in 1812, he had set up his business and family for success. His five sons were establishing and running banks in Frankfurt, Vienna, London, Paris and Naples. Because the brothers cooperated and used their partnerships to their advantage, the five Rothschild houses in the finance hubs of Europe comprised the largest bank in the world at the time.  One thing they did to stay transparent amongst each other was that each brother informed the other four of his banks’s transactions on a weekly basis. However, since in the 1800s you couldn’t just send call someone on the phone, let alone send an iMessage or email, communicating across distances was a problem.  In a business that thrives on information, speed of communication is key. Moreover, since the government postal services weren’t only slow, but also nosy and kept opening letters with sensitive information, paying a premium for express delivery also stopped working at some point.  Since even the best solution wasn’t good enough any longer, the Rothschilds created their own, private courier service.  They picked people they knew and trusted, paid them well and chose the fastest routes from A to B for them. And until the telegraph and railway came around in the 1830s, it remained the best way to communicate privately and quickly within Europe.  When nothing works quite like you want it to, build your own solution. Not only will you solve your own problem, you’ll even have something you can sell to people.                           Lesson 3: You can expect the 80/20 rule to apply in even the most extreme circumstances and businesses. The 80/20 Principle says that 20% of the input will get you 80% of the results. You’ll find it’s true in most aspects of life – for example 20% of the items in the trash can I’m looking at right now account for 80% of the volume that’s filled up (I’m guessing it’s the pizza boxes) – but it’s especially important to remember in business.  In case of the Rothschilds, this showed in a surprising way. In 1848 many revolutions took place across Europe, including Germany. And one party, who always loses in revolutions, is the rich and elite faction. Houses of the Rothschilds were attacked and their banking business suffered tremendous losses.  So many in fact, that the conglomerate was about to go bankrupt. However, because the London branch had always outperformed the others (and Britain was spared from social upheaval), the English Rothschild bank was able to bail out all other four banks.  As you can see, even in extreme cases like this one, where super wealthy businesses are about to go bust quickly, the 80/20 rule still applies. Chances are, you’ll find it somewhere in your business too, and it’s worth remembering.",

          "Book-description ": "Walter Isaacson's worldwide bestselling biography of Apple cofounder Steve Jobs. Based on more than forty interviews with Steve Jobs conducted over two years--as well as interviews with more than 100 family members, friends, adversaries, competitors, and colleagues--Walter Isaacson has written a riveting story of the roller-coaster life and searingly intense personality of a creative entrepreneur whose passion for perfection and ferocious drive revolutionized six industries: personal computers, animated movies, music, phones, tablet computing, and digital publishing. Isaacson's portrait touched millions of readers. At a time when America is seeking ways to sustain its innovative edge, Jobs stands as the ultimate icon of inventiveness and applied imagination. He knew that the best way to create value in the twenty-first century was to connect creativity with technology. He built a company where leaps of the imagination were combined with remarkable feats of engineering. Although Jobs cooperated with the author, he asked for no control over what was written. He put nothing off-limits. He encouraged the people he knew to speak honestly. He himself spoke candidly about the people he worked with and competed against. His friends, foes, and colleagues offer an unvarnished view of the passions, perfectionism, obsessions, artistry, devilry, and compulsion for control that shaped his approach to business and the innovative products that resulted. His tale is instructive and cautionary, filled with lessons about innovation, character, leadership, and values. Steve Jobs is the inspiration for the movie of the same name starring Michael Fassbender, Kate Winslet, Seth Rogen, and Jeff Daniels, directed by Danny Boyle with a screenplay by Aaron Sorkin.",

          "Book-summary ": "Lesson 1: Steve Jobs’s reality distortion field got its name from his team. The skill that allowed Steve Jobs to create this huge vision for Apple out of nothing was not his obsession for detail, nor his sense for design, simplicity, or aesthetics.  It was his reality distortion field, or RDF in short. The phrase was originally coined by Bud Tribble, part of Steve’s Macintosh team, who borrowed the term from Star Trek.  Talking about Steve’s RDF became a thing, and what it meant, was this:  Once Steve decided that something should happen, he would bend reality to his will until it came true.  This extended to everyone around him. His RDF is how he could convince a sleepless team of engineers to work another 10 hours on Macintosh fonts, because it would be the greatest computer in the world.  He also used it to make sure anyone who left an official Apple keynote was convinced the product they just saw was the best in its industry.  By using charisma, hyperbole, marketing and persistence, Steve would pull impossible feats into the realm of the possible for himself and his audience, allowing him to create what has become the most valuable technology company in the world.                           Lesson 2: There is one major reason for Apple’s name. The first thing anyone wonders about upon learning about Apple and its products is where the hell it got that name. They’re not selling smoothie makers, after all.  Of course there are several reasons for the name, one being that Steve was often experimenting with fruitarian diets, and, since he really liked apples, had been on an apple farm the same day the name had to be decided for official filing to the government.  Another reason is that “Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication”, a quote by Leonardo DaVinci, was the slogan for Apple’s first brochure, and Steve felt the apple symbolized this quote really well.  But the one major reason for Apple’s name has nothing to do with personal preferences and symbolism, it’s a simple, clear-cut business decision: Apple comes before Atari in the phonebook.  Steve had worked at Atari before, and didn’t want people to see his competitor first, when looking for a computer company.  I’m not sure if “Phaser Beam Computers” was ever in play (Matrix Electronics definitely was), but the discussion about the name is also one of the funniest scenes of the 2013 Jobs movie.                   Lesson 3: Steve Jobs did not become a billionaire from Apple products, but from Pixar’s IPO. Have you ever wondered who Steve Jobs became a billionaire? Everyone assumes all of his money came from Apple, but his bank account actually made the biggest jump on a whole other project.  After being fired from Apple in 1985, Steve really sunk his teeth into two projects: NeXT and Pixar.  Teeth in this case also means money. Steve paid a $100,000 flat fee, for the logo design for NeXT alone. That, next to countless delays and some other costly production standard demands made NeXT a black hole where money disappeared like nothing.  In the Pixar case, Steve purchased a majority share of the company (80%) from George Lucas for $5 million in 1986, and invested another $5 million right into the company.  By 1995, Steve’s total Pixar bill had racked up to a grand total of $50 million. He often considered selling it, until a deal with Disney came through to produce and distribute Toy Story in 1995.  Grossing over $350 million, the movie became the most successful movie of the entire year. This of course led to a very optimistic outlook for the company, which held its initial public offering on November 29, that year.  The company’s stock was priced at US$22 per share, giving Steve a 20x return on his initial investment and making him a billionaire over night.  His stocks were now worth $1.2 billion.",

          "Book-summary ": "Lesson 1: Big crowds reach smarter decisions than individuals. When Francis Galton visited a livestock fair in 1906, he surely wasn’t expecting this. Over 800 contestants entered a contest where they had to guess the weight of an ox.  Being a true scientist, Galton took a close look at the statistical data (hard work by the way, without Excel), and found no one guessed the true weight of the ox (1,198 lbs), correctly.  The closest guess was 1,207 lbs, still 9 pounds off.  However, when he calculated the average weight guess of all participants, he was shocked: 1,197 lbs. The crowd as a whole was just 1 lb off.  This phenomenon persists, even though weight guessing contests have gone a bit out of fashion.  A modern example would be Wikipedia. While no single person could have provided all the information for Mr. Galt’s Wikipedia article, the combined power of Wikipedia’s open contributor model helped create a sound report on the man.                              Lesson 2: Herd behavior can weaken the power of crowd decisions. Sometimes groups reach wrong decisions, despite being big and diverse. One of the reasons can be herd behavior.  Humans are social beings, and thus we naturally feel safer if we go with the common opinion of the crowd. It lets us hide inside the crowd and protects us from potentially looking like a fool or even being expelled from the group.  Remember when you told your parents that you “have to stay till 12 am at Jake’s party, because everyone else gets to stay that late?“. Yeah, that’s what I’m talking about.  Note: The cool thing about this particular example was that it worked if everyone told this to their parents, none of whom had originally agreed to staying out that late 😀  There are 2 factors that strengthen this natural tendency of ours:  Social proof Social rank Social proof is what most websites nowadays use to make you buy their stuff. It can come in the form of “X number of customers”, “join 40,000 subscribers”, or the number of people who backed a Kickstarter project for 3D printed soles.  If we know members of a group have used a certain service, or trust a person, it’s easier for us to trust the same brand or individual.  However, this goes wrong when we accept social proof and use it as a replacement for doing our own thinking.  In a similar fashion, hierarchy can have a big influence on whether we follow the herd.  This happens all the time in politics, where only a few are allowed to speak, but the entire group has to reach a decision, such as the German Bundestag or the US senate.  Because the leader is assumed to be an authority, we follow his or her opinion. A worst-case-scenario of herd behavior can be seen in the mass suicide of Heaven’s Gate, a UFO-related sect, where 39 members followed the leader into death to be taken away from earth by UFOs.  Even if we are smarter in groups, we should still always think independently and make up our own mind. Only then will the group reach the best decision.                                        Lesson 3: You should think more like a pedestrian. Why do groups work in the first place? Because they automatically coordinate themselves, as long as everyone’s looking out for other people.  Take walking on the street as an example.  When you walk around, do you bump into other people all the time? Of course not!  You adjust to the group and walk faster or slower, in order to avoid crashing into people, and you also anticipate where others are going, so you can pass them left or right.  Note: Have you ever noticed how hard it is to pass someone once you’ve made eye contact? Once we consciously note someone coming towards us, it becomes a 1-on-1 exchange, and there’s no group to adapt to. That’s why you might find yourself going left, right, left, only to end up right in front of the person you just looked at.  The summary made a great analogy for life here: People who look where others want to go reach their own goals faster.  So think a bit more like a pedestrian, and everyone will win!",

          "Book-summary ": "Lesson 1: The CEO should be the first one to shout when a crisis occurs. Have you ever worked in a place where there was a lot of gossip? If so, it might have been due to a cover-up policy. A lot of companies try to cover up crises or when things go wrong, in order to solve them quietly while the employees think everything is great.  This is a sucker’s move for 2 reasons:  Information about a crisis always leaks through, so eventually, your employees will find out anyway. By trying to solve the problem alone and in secrecy, you’re not allocating the resources to it that it deserves and needs. Imagine you’re being sued for a technical malfunction of your product.  You could try to hire a great lawyer, go to court and fend off the charges. However, eventually someone will spill the beans about your trip to the courtroom, causing all of your employees to panic about the sudden news and wonder if they’ll get fired.  Instead, what if you were the first one to divulge the bad news, and do so as soon as possible? You could rally everyone together and just honestly say you’re in trouble.  This will not only ease the burden on your own shoulders as CEO, it’ll also help get the problem in the hands of the people that are most capable of solving it.  Now an engineer can look at what went wrong and if it was an actual product malfunction or just operated in the wrong way.  Don’t think your employees can’t handle the truth. Be honest and upfront about bad news, and your entire company will benefit from it.                                     Lesson 2: There are 2 types of CEOs. Good ones, and bad ones. Joke!  Horowitz makes 2 interesting distinctions, he calls them Ones and Twos.  This is in no means an order. Ones are the strategic CEOs, the visionaries, those who are great at finding a path the company can follow.  They love making strategic decisions and aren’t afraid to pivot the company when it needs to. A good example of a One is Bill Gates.  Twos prefer execution and managing over researching and trying to make decisions. They’re the practical CEOs, who love to implement, direct a team and get stuff done.  For a company to truly shine, you need to have enough of both qualities, so if you’re a One, get some Two skills and vice versa.  Horowitz calls these functional Ones, which are important to have as executives as well. For example, if your marketing director is a functional One, she’ll be cool with making strategic marketing decisions (since it’s her area of expertise), but would rather just implement what you tell her is important for the general direction of the company.  So make sure you learn the part you don’t do as well, or at least attract the right people for the job.                                  Lesson 3: What makes a great CEO is to be comfortable being uncomfortable. This is what it comes down to. As a CEO, you’ll always be responsible for everything, whether it’s the new product that bombed or Steve’s clash with Sally over the last piece of cake.  You might as well just get used to being uncomfortable. After all, you’ll be in this state for quite some time (more like always).  The job of a CEO is unnatural in so many ways and often you’ll have to go against what your instincts tell you, so one of the best things you can do is practicing to leave your comfort zone in advance.  Outside of your comfort zone is where the magic happens.  Now go make some magic!",

          "Book-summary ": "Lesson 1: Safety means progress. And leaders provide safety. Think about the last time you made a lot of progress on a fun little side project of yours. Where there was nothing to gain but the joy of doing it.  Were you worried about paying that month’s bills?  Probably not.  The reason you could focus entirely on making progress on something you care about, is because your basic needs were already secured in that particular moment. Had they not, it would’ve been unlikely you could spend 8 hours playing guitar without worrying about them.  Our brain always defaults to safety mode, and the reason is simple: it had to in the past, or we wouldn’t be here.  Today all of our safety problems revolve around money, but our ancestors had tons of safety issues. They had to run away from saber-tooth tigers, hide from enemies, avoid diseases, and oh, hunt and gather their own food and find a place to stay.  Progress only started occurring once they moved around in groups and delegated tasks. When John takes care of collecting berries, and Jason hunts some wild boar, while Jenny finds a nice cave, Joshua can spend all his time crafting a new spear.  That’s why a leaders job is to provide safety to his followers, so they can focus on making progress towards their shared vision. The bigger the circle of safety around the group, the faster the progress.  For example, Google draws a pretty awesome circle of safety around its employees. Free food, ask-any-question meetings and 20% time for your own experiments are a pretty safe environment to be in.  Once you’re not worried about avoiding threats, you can start improving.  Note: For the same reason I’m working my ass off to get to $1,000 in passive income per month 🙂                                          Lesson 2: Responsibility means truly caring about other people, so don’t get detached. Let’s say you manage the finances of your company. In that case, your responsibility might be to “allocate the budget in a way that maximizes profits”.  But in reality, it’s your job to make sure the money goes to the people that will use it the best. Maybe you want to shut down a division. If so, you’re not only shutting down a part of the company, you’re robbing people of their safety, by firing them from their jobs.  This doesn’t mean you should try to save everyone, but you have to be aware that the consequences of your actions as a leader directly impact the lives of people.  That’s why empathy is the most important trait of a leader. If you can really put yourself into other people’s shoes, you will truly care about them, and thus be worth for them to follow you.  It’s easy to get detached when companies grow, and when that happens the consequences of your actions seem less real. Often leaders will then make decisions at other people’s expenses.   For example in 2009 the Peanut Corporation of America knowingly shipped contaminated peanuts to maintain cashflow, causing a nationwide salmonella crisis.  My own email list sits at 1500 people right now. It’s easy to blast out a mass email, but this was a great reminder that behind every single email address, there is a human being, and it’s my responsibility to send them the best and most helpful email I possibly can.  Note: For more info on this, check out the Milgram experiment.                                                 Lesson 3: Technology has turned us into performance addicts, looking for the next dopamine hit. Our ancestor Grok was really glad when that runner’s high kicked in on the last few yards before the cave, so he could jump to safety and not be eaten by a bear.  But today that’s not a big issue, which is why your dopamine cells have decided to reward you for great performance instead. Companies’ reward systems often work according to the mantra “More is always better.”, but sadly, each new sales record you set will make you feel less happy.  Instead of focusing on lasting value, we change the color of our profile picture on Facebook, or tweet something with a human rights hashtag, and feel really good for completing a task.  This is much easier than actually going out, for example by volunteering, and doing something about it, so our brain will settle for the “Like” on Facebook as a substitute.  This is addicting though and will only make you feel empty inside. So don’t hope for the next funny cat video, but do something that’s hard instead – you’ll feel a real sense of accomplishment afterwards.",

          "Book-summary ": "Lesson 1: If you have an idea people think is stupid, only trust your instincts. You’ve been there before. I know you have. You came up with something you thought was a BRILLIANT idea, like using iPads in restaurants to replace waiters.  Your friends instantly proceed to tell you how stupid the idea is. “People want the human interaction, that’ll never fly.” “iPads are expensive, that’s stupid!” Discouraged, you give up on your idea before you even started.  Actually, the second you heard the word “stupid”, you should’ve listened up. Some of the world’s greatest business ideas were considered stupid. But people started them anyway, because they trusted their gut feeling and not their friends’ opinions.  The telephone in 1876? Considered a total waste of time. Harry Potter? Rejected by 11 publishers. Oh and that iPad thing? Happened to me in 2011. I had the idea to create a restaurant where people sit down, have an iPad in their table, and instantly order from there.  Stupid? Yes. But in 2012, I ordered at a restaurant at the Toronto airport with this exact method. Don’t give a damn about what people say. If anything, take “stupid” as an indicator that you’re on to something great.                                   Lesson 2: Give yourself the freedom to fail by breaking your idea down into small projects. Now your idea can be as stupid as you want, but that doesn’t mean you get to be stupid about how you execute it. If your goal is to run a successful blog, it’s super easy to postpone even starting, because there are so many things to do.  You have to buy the domain, set up the website, pick a design and then there are god knows how many blog posts to write before you ever get somewhere. But looking at your project like this won’t help you execute it.  Instead, chunk your idea into the smallest projects you can manage. This way, you allow yourself to fail on a small scale, without ever questioning your idea in itself.  For example, you can pick one of three topics and write 4 blog posts in a month about it. If none of them elicit any interesting comments or favorable feedback, you can just choose the next topic and start over. Your topic failed, but your idea is still very much intact.  Don’t focus on the big picture, just on the very next step. Would I love Four Minute Books to be this gigantic stash of 1000 book summaries? Sure. But instead of obsessing over how much work that takes, I’d rather focus on just writing one summary per week.  As long as I continue doing that, I’ll be there faster than I think.                              Lesson 3: Work with what you’ve got, instead of making excuses. Yes, you don’t have the money to buy a fancy ice cream machine. Sure, you’ve never run an ice cream parlor before. Okay, none of your friends have one either, I get it. But getting fixated on what you don’t have won’t move you one inch closer to your goal. Not one bit.  So work with what you’ve got. Start selling ice cream out of your kitchen window. Make it with a shitty ice cream maker you bought on Amazon for $20. And just learn as you go.  Leverage the things other people have done. No movie theater makes its own movies, farmers don’t lay their own eggs and Google really just points you to other websites. If you want to start a daily vlog, use the camera that’s on your laptop. Get a free WordPress domain if you can’t afford one.  Don’t think everything has to be perfect. You’re just starting out. So use what you have, it’s a lot better than making excuses.",

          "Book-summary ": "Lesson 1: Don’t let your commissions eat up your profits. Like anything, becoming a good trader won’t happen overnight, but while you can’t skip getting all the experience necessary to make a decent living at it, what you can skip are a few rookie mistakes.  Commissions, for example. No matter which broker you sign up with, they’ll take a commission for every single trade you make. These aren’t cheap, so $10 per trade is a very common fee to pay. But if you’re just starting out, you probably don’t have too much money to invest, so if you trade a lot, the commissions will eat up your entire profits.  Imagine you’re investing $10,000 over the course of a year, doing 4 trades a week, which is not a lot. At $10 per trade, you pay $40 each week, just in commissions! If you keep this up 50 weeks of the year, you’ll pay $2000 in commissions – 20% of your entire trading capital!  That’s why it’s important to pick a broker with very low fees in the beginning and keep your trading to a minimum. I signed up with Degiro, a Dutch online broker, who has very low fees (less than $1 per trade on most trades) and only make 2-3 trades per month.                            Lesson 2: Leave your emotions at home. Another rookie mistake is trading emotionally. Just like in a good poker game, emotions have no place in trading. You can’t feel personally attached to any one stock and shouldn’t just buy a company’s stock because you like their product.  When you bring emotions into trading, you’ll start to gamble. When you feel incapable of resisting the urge to trade, or like “that one stock’s gonna take off” and let your trades influence your emotions, that’s when you know you’re trading like a gambler (great movie, btw).  But trading is just a way to make money, and just like you don’t emotionally obsess over your paycheck, rent, debit card or phone bill, you can’t do it with trading either.  Once you let your emotions control how you trade, you can literally watch your capital go down to zero in an instant. So leave your emotions at home and trade with a mind as cool as the coins you want it to put inside your pocket.                                  Lesson 3: Minimize your risk with two simple rules. Elder has two wonderful rules to help you avoid gambling and minimize your risks and losses. They’re called the 2% rule and the 6% rule.  The 2% rule says you can’t risk more than 2% of your entire trading capital on a single trade. For example, if you have $100,000 total to invest, buy a stock for $50, and set a stop loss at $48 (meaning the stock is automatically sold if it falls to $48), you can buy 1000 shares. Your maximum loss is $2 per share, so $2,000, equaling 2% of your entire capital.  However, if you don’t set a stop loss, you could only buy 40 shares, because 40 x $50 = $2,000 and without a stop loss you can, in theory, lose it all.  The 6% rule compliments the 2% rule by stating that if your total losses + open risks in any given month exceed 6% of your total capital, you can’t make any new trades.  Let’s assume this month you’ve taken that $2,000 loss described above already, and have another 4 trades open, with a potential loss of $1,000 each. That comes out to $6,000 and means you shouldn’t make any new trades until the month is up, to make sure you don’t lose more than 6% of your total capital, if the 4 other trades go sour as well.",

It was immediately welcomed as an antidote to hard times and remained a bestseller for decades.

          "Book-summary ": "Lesson 1: Use autosuggestion to build an unshakable belief in yourself. Autosuggestion is a psychological technique developed in the early 20th century.  Basically, it makes use of the Placebo effect by turning your goals into self-fulfilling prophecies through imprinting them in your subconscious.  Hill says a key trait of all successful people is this absolutely incredible, unshakable belief that they have about themselves and their goals.  It’s not a result, more a necessary prerequisite, to become successful.  By telling yourself over and over and over again, that it is possible for you to achieve your goals, that you can make your dreams a reality, and that you have to go your own way and can’t let anyone interfere with it, you form these beliefs in your subconscious.  This builds not only the confidence you need to follow through on your actions, but also lets your goals seep into the unconscious part of your brain, until you automatically align all of your actions in a way that leads you towards your goals.  But what else can you use this belief that could move mountains for?                   Lesson 2: Be stubborn and always stick to your decisions. Maybe you could use it to become a little hardheaded. In fact, you should.  Hill quotes lack of determination as the most common reason for long-term failure.  Millionaires, on the other hand, make snap decisions, and then they stick to them.  Come hell or high water.  When Henry Ford decided the Model T would be his masterpiece, he knew this would be it for the long haul. In spite of people telling him to come up with a new model again and again, he stuck to his guns. How long did production run?  The first model was produced in August 1908, and started the craze that turned into 15 million units total – the last of which was manufactured in 1927 – 19 years later.  Opinions are cheap. Everyone has one, and most people dispense them like they’re paper towels, only cluttering your mind with negative influences.  So be careful who you share your goals with, make it a set of trusted advisors, close friends and allies only – a mastermind maybe?                     Lesson 3: Join a Mastermind group to accelerate your learning. Yes, this is where this concept comes from and yes, it’s that old.  Napoleon Hill invented the Mastermind group as we know it today.  Millions of people use it (I’m in one as well), and with the internet, it’s become a worldwide phenomenon, as it’s gotten easier to hold a Mastermind session with people from around the globe.  Here’s how Hill defined a Mastermind group originally: “The coordination of knowledge and effort of two or more people, who work toward a definite purpose, in the spirit of harmony.”  Today, most groups consist of 4 people, which are not necessarily working towards the exact same goal or at the same company, but who are in the same industry and share many problems, obstacles, as well as character traits.  However, groups can be of any size, the only rule being that each session must follow a specific agenda (here’s the one we use).  The main benefit is that by combining the brain power of two or more people to solve problems, the result is more than the sum of its parts.  There is a surplus from sharing experiences, ideas and skills that could never be achieved if each person worked on their stuff alone, and that’s why Masterminds are so powerful.",

          "Book-summary ": "Lesson 1: Never underestimate the exponential power of compounding interest. If you’ve read more summaries on here from the personal finance category you might think I’m preaching to the choir, but people really don’t understand this.  It’s because exponential growth is so big, it’s hard to grasp for the human mind. The best way to astonish yourself is to look at examples of this, like the folding paper to the moon story or how 10 early years of investing are worth more than 35 years of late investing.  This book makes another great example of this.  When Benjamin Franklin died in 1790, he left $1,000 for both the cities of Boston and Philadelphia, but only after investing it and not touching it for 100 years. Then they could withdraw a portion of it and had to let it sit for another 100 years.  After 100 years, Philadelphia withdrew $500,000 to build the Franklin Institute, a museum. The final balance for the bank account in 1990, another 100 years later, was $2 million.  Boston did an even better job at investing and has turned $1,000 into a glorious $4.5 million.  Insane?  Yes! So please, please NEVER underestimate the power of compounding interest.                             Lesson 2: Show yourself you can reach financial freedom by picking one of five goals. If I asked you what the perfect amount of money is for you to make, 9 out of 10 of you would reply with: a million dollars.  Why a million dollars?  We are drawn to this figure like flies to the light. But it’s just an arbitrary number.  Here’s one that’s much more important: $51,000.  Why?  Because it’s the average annual spending of an American adult.  If you can make $51,000 from investments, you never have to work again. That’s all it takes. A million is 20 times as much.  Doesn’t that make you feel at ease?  This makes it a lot easier to reach your financial goals.  How far you want to go is up to you, and setting specific goals will help you be realistic about what you can achieve in which period of time.  Here are 3 of the goals Tony suggests:  Make enough money from investments to pay for basic living costs: rent, food, utilities, a potential mortgage, and transport. Make enough money from investments to pay for basic living costs plus fun, like travel, going to the movies, buying new clothes regularly, etc. Make enough money from investments to be financially independent and never have to work again, i.e. $51,000 per year. For number 3 you need $640,000 invested so that you’ll get 8% annual return – which is just a little more than the average return of the stock market in any given year.  You can never make a million dollars in your entire life, but still reach a point where you never have to work again.                        Lesson 3: Use Tony’s 3-bucket system to diversify your investments. Here’s a very simple way to allocate all of your investment money (10% of your income is a good portion and will get you quite far, quite fast, without hurting your spending too much).  Tony suggests having 3 buckets.  A security bucket. A growth bucket. A dream bucket. The security bucket contains safe investments, like bonds, which won’t yield a lot of return, but are very unlikely to make you lose money.  The growth bucket is for riskier investments, like stocks, which often beat average returns in the long run, but are highly volatile in the short run, and might take you a while to pan out.  The dream bucket gets some of the profits you make from the other two buckets, for example, 10% of your portfolio value at the end of every year.  Making a lot of money is only meaningful when you actually use the money to live the life you want – so without a dream bucket, what good are the other two?",

          "Book-summary ": "Lesson 1: Start taking responsibility for your money Much like Rich Dad Poor Dad, this book starts with a necessary reminder to start accepting you’re the one in the cockpit, when it comes to your money.  Most people agree that they “should exercise more” or are “supposed to eat less junk food”. Even if they can’t make the change, at least the insight’s there. But have you ever heard anyone say: “I really need to get better at handling my money.”?  Rarely.  Because no one likes to admit that they’re bad with money. Even though a lot of people are.  Yes, there are plenty of people and factors to blame. Like the media, confusing you with all this contradictory information. Or the education system, which never taught you how to spend your money, save it, let alone invest it.  But excuses will always stay what they are: excuses. No matter how right they might be.  Saving and investing money is scary, and you might lose some money, but better to lose it now, rather than tomorrow. The younger you are, the more risk you should take on, because it’s still easy for you to make back the money.  And even though it will take a while to see results, if you can only afford to invest a little, you should never neglect the power of compounding interest.  So stop making excuses, and start taking responsibility for your personal finances. It’s the first step towards getting rich.                            Lesson 2: Take fixed cuts off your paycheck and automatically spend them towards your goals Sitting down every month to see how much you want to spend on what is a hassle. No one wants to do that.  Which is why Ramit suggests a Conscious Spending Plan. What he means by that is: Take cuts off your paycheck and automatically spend them towards the right things.  For example: Use 60% of your income to pay fixed costs, like rent, utilities, food and your credit card bill. Then, invest 10%, for example in stocks, your 401(k), or Roth IRA. Save another 10% for vacations, Christmas presents and unexpected costs.  This leaves you with 20% of your money, which you can spend on whatever you like, guilt-free.  Automate these processes and payments, for example I personally save $50 every month, which is automatically taken out of my bank account on the 1st.  This way I make sure I save at least $600 per year, and there’s no chance I’m spending that money accidentally.  As with any habit, removing the need for willpower makes it a lot easier to get it right.                              Lesson 3: Start investing today. No joke. Investing is hard. You have to read books, talk to people, and educate yourself. But you will regret every single day you waited to start doing it once you’re old.  Why? I found a great example, that puts it in numbers.  If you invest $5,000 every year (which is $417/month) for 10 years, from age 25 to age 35 and then never invest again, you’d still have more money at retirement, than someone who starts at age 35 and invests $5,000 every year UNTIL they retire.  The 25 year old starter invests $55,000 and ends up with $615,000 (given an 8% annual return, which is close to the average return of the stock market per year). The 35 year old invests $130,000 and ends up with $431,000.  Do you realize how insane that is? You can invest less than half and end up with one and a half times as much money!  Just by starting 10 years earlier.  So yeah, you better start today.  I Will Teach You To Be Rich suggests maxing out your 401(k) to get the maximum from your employer (they will usually match your contribution, up to a certain point) and then also investing in a Roth IRA, another form of retirement plan, but one that you control, and lifecycle funds, which invest your money automatically, shifting from riskier to safer investments as you age.  Soon after I read Money – Master The Game by Tony Robbins, which recommended index funds. James Altucher likes stocks and cash.It’s complicated. No arguments there. Which brings me right back to lesson 1.  Start taking responsibility and act today.",

          "Book-summary ": "Lesson 1: Manage your money with multiple bank accounts. In most couples, the men love to deal with the family’s finances. Moving money around feels powerful, no matter how little you’re shoveling from left to right and back. Whether traditional gender roles apply or not, your partner may not love spreadsheets, budgeting and investing as much as you do, or vice versa.  However, one of the first things Scott realized about personal finance is that it’s important to have both parents involved. This, in turn, requires a system that is simple enough to understand and explain in a few minutes. That’s why Scott came up with the serviette strategy. It’s a 3-bucket structure to manage all incoming money and it fits on a single napkin.  The 3 tiers are:  Blow. This is the bucket for all your everyday expenses, a bit of splurging, and some emergency money. Mojo. A place for long-term savings in case of a bigger financial rough patch. Should ideally be 3 months of expenses. Grow. Where your retirement and wealth investments go. You can set up the entire system with five bank accounts:  Daily. 60% of your income goes here to cover rent, food, mortgage, etc. Splurge. 10% is for short-term fun treats, like going to the movies or a new handbag. Smile. 10% for long-term rewards, like a vacation. Fire Extinguisher. 20% used to stuff burning holes in your pocket, like credit card debt. Mojo. An account with a separate bank, where all extra cash goes, for example from overtime hours or a garage sale. The big trick is directing your money where it’s supposed to go before it gets there. With this system, you can manage your finances in less than an hour per month, even if you don’t like dealing with it.                                Lesson 2: Start eliminating your debt by cutting up your credit cards. Once you’ve set up your buckets, Scott has an interesting take on how you can instantly build momentum: Take a pair of scissors and cut all your credit cards into tiny pieces. Paying off your credit card debt first is a common strategy. It’s usually small enough to be manageable, but big enough to make you feel you’ve accomplished something meaningful.  However, by destroying your credit cards first, you eliminate the possibility of racking up more debt with them while you’re trying to catch up. Once you’ve burned those bridges, it’s time to get cracking.  Call your bank and tell them about an 18-month zero interest offer from [insert competitor bank.] You might not have that, but you don’t need to. As long as it gets them to reduce your interest and fees on your current credit card debt, that’s fine. With the best conditions set, you can start using the money from your fire extinguisher account to slowly pay down your debt and get the ball rolling.                             Lesson 3: Use index funds for long-term, automated growth. Living debt-free is one thing, but actively growing your money is another. And that’s the thing. To most people, the ‘active’ part seems risky and daunting. Hence, Scott recommends dipping your toe into the water with an approach to investing we’ve discussed on Four Minute Books before: index funds. First commercialized by Jack Bogle in the 70s, these nifty investment vehicles simply track and trace the biggest, most common stocks in a given industry or geographic region.  For example, the Vanguard Total World Stock Index Fund models a basket of over 8,000 stocks worldwide, thus echoing annual global stock market returns at just 0.19% in fees. After all, once the stocks are selected for the year, there’s not much to update! Since the fund manager doesn’t buy and sell stocks all the time, you don’t pay them a premium.  Not even Warren Buffett beats the stock market as a whole, so as a first source of long-term, automated growth, index funds are your best choice. And Vanguard offers a whole variety of them. Just pick one and get started.",

When you’re making a webinar, you have to think about 4 different elements:  Build rapport Emphasize the One Thing The Three Secrets (vehicle, internal and external struggles) Stack the deck for sale When you’re planning your webinar, the first thing you need to do is build rapport. This is a simple way of saying that you need to make people feel comfortable with you so they’ll listen to what you have to say.  The second element of a successful webinar is to emphasize One Thing. This should be the central focus of your presentation and can help guide the entire presentation, as well as give attendees something concrete to take away from it.  The third element is The Three Secrets: Vehicle (your product), Internal Struggles (problems that your product solves), and External Struggles (the competition). These three elements will help your audience understand why their lives will be better if they purchase your product.  The final element is Stacking the Deck for Sale: this means making it easy for attendees to buy from you during or after the webinar. You can do this by providing links, offering discounts on products or services, offering a free trial, and having contact information available at all times.                     Lesson 3: If you want to build a successful email campaign, try the five-email-sequence first. This 5-email sequence is about the origin story, a new opportunity, internal belief change, external belief change, and the stack or sales.  The origin story is an email that outlines how you found your product. You can use this email to provide some context for how you got into the business, or how you found your new company. This email should be short and sweet because it’s just an introduction to what comes next.  The second email explains the new opportunity that has been presented to you. This is where you talk about what happened and how it will affect you personally and professionally. If any changes in your life or career resulted from this opportunity, this is where you explain them!  After that comes the internal belief change: why does this opportunity make sense to me? Why do I feel like it’s worth pursuing? What does it mean for my future? How am I going to approach it? This is where you write about any internal shifts or challenges that come with taking on this new opportunity.  Next comes the external belief change: what does this opportunity mean for other people? What does it mean for our team? For our organization? For our industry as a whole? Make this part about other stakeholders in particular.   Lastly, the stack or the sales is where you get to pitch and monetize your offerings, but not before they realize how much money they’ll make for believing in you. This part is about mutual growth and it tells people that they need to invest in themselves by investing in you.",

        "Book-description ": "Reclaim the power of genuine human connection  Networking is often considered a necessary evil for all working professionals. With social media platforms like Linkedin, Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook at our disposal, reaching potential investors or employers is much easier. Yet, these connections often feel transactional, agenda-driven, and dehumanizing, leaving professionals feeling burnt out and stressed out.  Instead, we should connect on a human level and build authentic relationships beyond securing a new job or a new investor for your next big idea. To build real and meaningful networking contacts, we need to go back to basics, remembering that technology is a tool and more than just a means to an end. We need to tap into our humanity and learn to be more intentional and authentic.  As a \"serial connector\" and communications expert, Susan McPherson has a lifetime of experience building genuine connections in and out of work. Her methodology is broken down into three simple steps: Gather: Instead of waiting for the perfect networking opportunity to come to you, think outside the box and create your own opportunity. Host your own dinner party, join a local meet-up group, or volunteer at your neighborhood food pantry.    Ask: Instead of leading with our own rehearsed elevator pitches asking for help, ask to help, opening the door to share resources, experience, contacts, and perspectives that add diversity to your own vision.    Do: Turn new connections into meaningful relationships by taking these newly formed relationships deeper. Follow through on the promises you made and keep in touch. Woven together with helpful tips and useful advice on making the most out of every step, this book draws on McPherson's own experience as a renowned \"serial connector,\" as well as the real life success stories of friends and clients. Filled with humor, humility, and wisdom, The Lost Art of Connecting is the handbook we all need to foster personal and professional relationships that blur the lines between work and play--and enrich our lives in every way.",

        "Book-summary ": "Lesson 1: To develop meaningful connections, you’ll have to offer your attention and help to those around you Oftentimes, people engage in conversations and try to network for purely transactional purposes. They think that they’ll eventually gain something from establishing a relationship with a certain individual, which is also a reason why they choose not to communicate with people that don’t possess anything of interest to them.   In a world where everyone strives to climb the social scale, relationships have become a tool, rather than an existential part of life. To break this vicious cycle, we’ll have to switch our focus to the most important part of a relationship: giving. When you try to offer people your help, they’ll be much kinder to you.  Everyone can feel when a relationship is superficial, which is often the result of a LinkedIn or Facebook befriending, or genuine, which mostly occur face to face. To break past the first layer, try to brainstorm a few ideas of how you can help the person next to you. Offer them something for free, be kind and generous, or simply ask them how you can be of use, without wanting something in return.  This way, your relationships will flourish, and you’ll get even more than if you were to engage in a transactional friendship. People remember those who are being nice to them and wish to repay the favor when the situation asks for it. Plus, your bonds will feel more authentic, and your social life will thrive!                           Lesson 2: Try asking for help in your group of friends and creating bonds with them A relationship always consists of at least two people who have to engage with each other and establish a bond. To strengthen that bond, you’ll need a starting point. Many people underestimate their network, thinking that socializing with new people starts from outside.   However, considering how many friends each individual from your network has on their own, it could be a good starting point to try and expand from within your regular circle. This is where you Gather. Find people to connect to and genuinely look to form meaningful connections.   At this stage, you might be surprised at how many connections you have! Once you’re in the process of forming meaningful connections, don’t be afraid to ask for help from your peers. Doing so will let them know that you trust them and that you don’t have a problem reaching out in times of need, which is what they’ll also do if the situation asks for it.   When asking for help, you’ll want to be specific. Always bond your request to a time frame and add details. Make your pitch as specific as possible, and aim to keep it under five minutes. This way, you won’t be a burden to your friend, and your connection will strengthen.                                    Lesson 3: Aim to form meaningful connections by asking genuine questions about the other You’re probably not going to become best friends with all the people you have a relationship with, but creating meaningful connections should be a top priority. To enrich your social life and form authentic bonds, you’ll have to become a good listener.  If people find it difficult to open up to you although you are treating them with care, learn to ask the right questions. Without being intrusive, find your way towards their true interests, concerns, and common struggles. Let them know that you’re a reliable person that they can trust.   It may be helpful to ask them questions like: “What do you usually do for fun”, “How did you go through the pandemic?”, and then move on to the most important part: Do. Using the RASA method, you can become a better listener. RASA stands for:  Receive Appreciate Summarize Ask Receiving implies being open (both mentally and through your body language) to your interlocutor. Then, nod and agree with what they’re saying so that they feel heard. Strengthen your connection by summarizing what they said in short points. This will make them feel valued and heard. Lastly, ask for details, or try to clarify parts of their story with phrases like: “Really?”, “How did that happen?”, etc.",

        "Book-description ": "The global phenomenon, embraced by business worldwide and now published in more than 40 languages.  This international bestseller challenges everything you thought you knew about the requirements for strategic success.  Since the dawn of the industrial age, companies have engaged in head-to-head competition in search of sustained, profitable growth. They have fought for competitive advantage, battled over market share, and struggled for differentiation. Yet, as this influential and immensely popular book shows, these hallmarks of competitive strategy are not the way to create profitable growth in the future.  In the international bestseller Blue Ocean Strategy, W. Chan Kim and Renee Mauborgne argue that cutthroat competition results in nothing but a bloody red ocean of rivals fighting over a shrinking profit pool. Based on a study of 150 strategic moves (spanning more than 100 years across 30 industries), the authors argue that lasting success comes not from battling competitors, but from creating \"blue oceans\"—untapped new market spaces ripe for growth. Such strategic moves, which the authors call “value innovation,” create powerful leaps in value that often render rivals obsolete for more than a decade.  Blue Ocean Strategy presents a systematic approach to making the competition irrelevant and outlines principles and tools any company can use to create and capture their own blue oceans. A landmark work that upends traditional thinking about strategy, this bestselling business book charts a bold new path to winning the future.",

        "Book-summary ": "Lesson 1: Instead of competing in a Red Ocean, learn to dive deep into the Blue Ocean. The book brings forth two types of markets, namely the Red and Blue Oceans. The first type of market is the battlefield of businesses, the place where they practice their operational activities, look for new sources to gain their competitive advantage, and pull the rug from each other’s feet.   This market is slightly nerve-wracking, as it implies allocating many resources to fight rivals, find new ground to conquer, and always watching over your shoulder to see if others are doing the same. This is where small, medium, and large enterprises fight their battles and try to win over consumers.  The Blue Ocean is an entirely new, untapped territory where not a lot of companies end up operating. Why? Because ending up in the Blue Ocean implies that executives of the said company spend time innovating and creating new products or services that cannot compete with what’s already on the market.   In the Red Ocean, it is difficult to look for new sources of revenue and innovate. In the Blue Ocean, this is your primary focus. You take time off from the competition and focus solely on innovation. If you succeed, you’re likely going to win without even having to fight, and consumers will migrate towards the new trend set by you.                     Lesson 2: Arriving at a Blue Ocean implies a strategy canvas that allows you to win the competition. Every business will have to fight its battles in the Red Ocean, regardless of its industry. Competition is a natural part of every company’s environment and growth, but it’s up to its executives to come up with ways to tame it while focusing on innovation. In other words, you’ll need to swim in the Red Ocean till you reach the Blue one.  One way to do this is by applying the canvas suggested by the authors. This canvas consists of four essential questions to ask yourself before you jump into the Blue Ocean:  Which of the factors that the industry takes for granted should be eliminated? Which factors should be reduced well below industry standard? Which factors should you raise above industry standard? Which factors should be created that have never been offered? The first question tries to open up a space for companies to evaluate the services or products they offer that consumers don’t care about and that they should eliminate to grow margins and focus on innovation.   For example, low-cost airlines eliminated airport lounges and offered more flights, which in turn grew their figures and increased their support from consumers who wanted more frequent flights instead of better lounges.   The second question is similar, but it asks what you can focus on to be the best while reducing the focus on another aspect just enough to keep it going at the bare minimum. Be the best in your area, not in all areas. This takes us to the third question: what would that area be? Where are you more likely to succeed? Focus on that area. Finally, the fourth question is all about innovation, or the Blue Ocean.                    Lesson 3: Jump into the Blue Ocean and make your competition seem irrelevant. Reaching the Blue Ocean is a big step for every company, because not only will it assure your survival in the market, but also grow your enterprise successfully, at least for a brief time. Innovation is at the cornerstone of every business, industry, and advancement of a field.   Innovation is essential to improve our world. Moreover, consumers are always looking for better products and services, so whoever is the first to offer a newer, shinier, more spectacular invention is likely to grab the attention of the masses.   To start doing so you’ll have to invest many resources into R&D and switch your focus from your competition now, to your offerings in the future. Do so through value innovation, which is a concept that implies creating a leap in value for your consumers. When you do that you open new territory to explore for your buyers.  You can create added value by improving what you already have, which is great, but it won’t make your company stand out. The second way to improve your customers’ lives is to offer new, improved products. A strong company focuses on both approaches to win over its consumers.",

        "Book-summary ": "Lesson 1: There are three core rules of advertising that you can use to market a successful brand. There are a lot of misconceptions associated with advertising. Marketers worldwide often promote products to the wrong market, at the wrong time, in all the wrong way. Fortunately, there is indeed a success formula – sort of – to use if you want to maximize your efforts.   The first rule of branding is the Law of Expansion. This law states that companies become weaker as they try to advertise a broad range of products or services. Take street shops and deli businesses that sell an incredible array of items. Do you have a brand in mind? Not really.   The first company to narrow its deli business was Subway, and it did the right move as it became an internationally recognized brand. The second law of branding is the Law of Contraction, which is practically the opposite of the first law. The more you narrow your offering, the easier it becomes to advertise.  This is how brands form and become recognizable. Similar to the first two laws, we’ve got the Law of Singularity, which preaches the importance of focusing efforts on creating a brand that’s synonym to an everyday object or idea. Prego is the spaghetti sauce, Rolex is the highly luxurious watch, and Walmart is the go-to place for cheap products.                     Lesson 2: The Law of Publicity and the Law of Advertising can help you build a brand that sells. The fourth law of marketing and branding is the Law of Publicity, which is key when it comes to building a brand from scratch. Publicity is essential to any brand looking to scale, regardless of its size. Without it, your business isn’t going to be successful. A great start is by being the first within an industry.  However, in such a competitive market, that can get tough. Still, you can make your product stand out by delivering extra features, implementing unique selling points, and just by being original overall. However, when it comes to advertising your already existing brand, the Law of Advertising comes in.  This law states that your purpose as a business is to defend your gain in the market after launch. You don’t do so by overly advertising your superiority over your competitors, or by spamming users with ads – all those strategies fail in the long run.   Users want to know that your product is the top choice within its category – and that’s what you should advertise. Focus on your offerings and why your product can change your customer’s life for the better, and not on what your competitor is doing. Make yourself stand out and hold on tight to the ground you’ve got.                Lesson 3: The last four laws of branding will get your product from average to exceptional. The sixth law of branding is the Law of the Word, which states that you should associate your brand with a powerful word. Mercedes is highly associated with “prestige”, while Honda is thought to be “well-engineered”. What’s your catchword?   What’s even better is to make the world associate your product with a concept itself. Think of companies like Xerox or Pampers who became worldwide used words. Now, on to the next law, which is the Law of Category. This one presents the idea of advertising an entire category of products once you’ve achieved leadership.  It will probably help your competition too, which is why it may sound counter-intuitive to do so. However, the more attention there is in the field, the more likely it is to have people buy even more from you. The eighth law is the Law of Credentials. This once states that you should build authority through factual claims.   You only need a great first impression and a one-time proven claim. Then, you’ll be able to make secondary assumptions based on your trust. This concept goes hand in hand with the tenth Law of Quality. This one is about the importance of the perception of quality. If you advertise your product as a top-quality one well-enough, people will buy it.",

        "Book-description ": "Haters are not your problem. . . . Ignoring them is.   Eighty percent of companies say they deliver out­standing customer service, but only 8 percent of their customers agree. This book will help you close that gap by reconfiguring your customer service to deliver knockout experiences.   The near-universal adoption of smartphones and social media has fundamentally altered the science of complaints. Critics (“haters”) can now express their displeasure faster and more pub­licly than ever. These trends have resulted in an overall increase in complaints and a belief by many businesses that they have to “pick their spots” when choosing to answer criticisms.   Bestselling author Jay Baer shows why that approach is a major mistake. Based on an exten­sive proprietary study of how, where, and why we complain, Hug Your Haters proves that there are two types of complainers, each with very differ­ent motivations:   ·Offstage haters. These people simply want solutions to their problems. They complain via legacy channels where the likelihood of a response is highest—phone, e-mail, and com­pany websites. Offstage haters don’t care if any­one else finds out, as long as they get answers. ·Onstage haters. These people are often disap­pointed by a substandard interaction via tradi­tional channels, so they turn to indirect venues, such as social media, online review sites, and discussion boards. Onstage haters want more than solutions—they want an audience to share their righteous indignation.   Hug Your Haters shows exactly how to deal with both groups, drawing on meticulously researched case studies from businesses of all types and sizes from around the world. It includes specific play­books and formulas as well as a fold-out poster of “the Hatrix,” which summarizes the best strate­gies for different situations. The book is also filled with poignant and hilarious examples of haters gone wild, and companies gone crazy, as well as inspirational stories of companies responding with speed, compassion, and humanity.   Whether you work for a mom-and-pop store or a global brand, you will have haters—and you can’t afford to ignore them. Baer’s insights and tactics will teach you how to embrace complaints, put haters to work for you, and turn bad news into good outcomes.",

        "Book-summary ": "Lesson 1: Recurrent buyers are responsible for the majority of your profits, so taking in their feedback is a must. Attracting new customers is a difficult road to take, but there are better options out there once you have a stable customer base: retaining them. The book suggests that by keeping even a small percentage of your customers loyal to you, profits can grow as much as 85% – now that’s a great business strategy!  Retaining loyal audiences is also much easier than acquiring new prospects, but it all comes with a catch – stellar customer service. When you offer better options, support, and products than your competition, chances are that the market will notice that and stick with you.   To become the go-to choice for people, you’ll have to continuously improve and work on the negative feedback. Receiving criticism can be tough, but if you acknowledge it, let your customers know that you’re actively working towards remediating it, and offer them support or even benefits like discounts or free-of-charge products, you’ll surely get through any situation successfully.   What’s also particularly important is to embrace negative feedback, instead of hiding it. Publicly remediation situations can grow your reliability and foster a good reputation. Then, chances are your customers will stay loyal to your brand and not migrate to other options that put more care and thought into their customers.                 Lesson 2: Use the H.O.U.R.S. method to address complaints and negative feedback. Now that we’ve understood the importance of accepting negative feedback and treating it as valuable input for your company, let’s go through some of the ways you can use it to address these complaints and concerns.   The author calls for the HOURS method, which stands for:  (Be) Human – get personal with your dissatisfied customers and tailor your response to their concerns. Treat them as human beings with distinctive personality traits, not just data sources.  (Use) One channel – don’t forward their complaints and pass them around. Don’t refer them to someone else, a FAQ channel, or anything at all. Simply fix their issue.  Unify data – get all the information you need to act upon their request and resolve it immediately.  Resolve – act quickly and fix the negative occurrence properly, not just to get it off of your chest, but to make it better for the customer. Speed – treat problems with a sense of urgency and fix them quickly.  Compile these solutions into a fully integrated method by discussing with your team and finding a procedure that you can implement together. Make sure each member receives training so that you’re all on the same page and that you set up a written procedure in place ready to go when such complaints occur.            Lesson 3: If you want to win the hearts of your customers again, use the F.E.A.R. method. Customers want to know that you’re willing to make sacrifices for their sake. By taking on the responsibility of improving their satisfaction, you’ll be showing them that they’re worth your time, which can make all the difference between a world-class experience and just another day at the office.  With the F.E.A.R method, you can easily spot, fix, and improve your public negative feedback in a timely manner. Here’s how to use it:  Find the public complaints on the internet through apps like Google Alerts or Mention.net to know where to start your quest of fixing complaints. Empathize with your customers by asking yourself how would you like to have this problem solved. Answer publicly so that you also build your reputation in the process. Reply once, and keep the thread short. More answers don’t necessarily provide added benefits; sometimes, they can spark an unnecessary conflict.  Switch channels if the situation asks for you to protect your client’s privacy. If the problem is serious or personal, it’s best to readdress them via email. Lastly, it’s best to keep an open eye on all reviews and be present when it comes to listening to your customers. Take care of your customers and always treat them well. These methods for handling customer service complaints will help you win new customers and keep the ones you have.",

        "Book-summary ": "Lesson 1: There are two core portfolios that a successful company should possess. Essentially, a strong company must focus on a multitude of internal and external factors to build long-term success. According to the author, this can be done through two core portfolios: The “explore portfolio” and the “exploit portfolio”.  The first one focuses on innovation, research and development of new ideas, and other future benefits in relation to the level of risk. This portfolio mostly focuses on ROI (return on investment) from future projects. The exploit portfolio targets the opposite type of projects. It focuses on strengthening the core operational aspects.  The exploit portfolio targets the strengths and weaknesses of a company and tries to improve the business overall. These two portfolios are essential for any company that wishes to keep up with the consumer changes and demands, while also maintaining a strong position in the market.   Nevertheless, both projects require different teams and a skilled workforce that matches the requirements of working in innovation on one side and strengthening core operations on the other. The two teams should collaborate frequently and maintain an open communication line, yet focus on their particular tasks.                         Lesson 2: The explore portfolio needs to be under continuous surveillance to generate desired returns. Explore projects are an essential part of any future growth strategy of a company. Although they can’t provide a guaranteed value for the company they are necessary for the long-term survival of any business. Therefore, a good executive will acknowledge their nature and try to switch their focus on reducing uncertainty.   Reducing risk and increasing the acceptance rate of such projects can happen in two stages: the design loop and the testing loop. The design loop is the initial phase where team members generate ideas, design prototypes, uncover flaws in the process, and adapt as they go.  The testing phase is about experimenting with the product, producing evidence about the real-life experience of using it, and strengthening its design if needed. This phase is essential to reduce the flaws of the prototype and therefore the risk that comes with bringing it to market.   A wise executive will allocate all the necessary resources to conduct such research at any given point, and be proactive in the production of new offerings. However, it’s best to maintain a healthy dose of skepticism and minimalize errors and implied risks at all times.                        Lesson 3: The Business Model Canvas can help you improve your traditional business model overall. The Business Model Canvas is a visualization method for companies who want to improve their model, cut on costs, increase efficiency, or get a better overall view of their organization. This canvas has three main points of analysis: the front end, the back end, and the cost and revenue considerations.  The front end refers to the customer’s side of the business, the market you’re addressing, the delivery channels, and the external factors of the business: market conditions, trends, and economical conditions. The back end targets the product itself, the resources and technology used, and the stakeholders.  The last part of the canvas consists of the viability, feasibility, and cost-related part of the business. Having this structure in mind allows organizations to get a better view of their business and see what areas of improvement they can consider.   For example, a company may choose to re-revaluate their cost frame by cutting or increasing the price, the back end of the product by adding features to it, or perhaps the front end and expand into new markets.",

        "Book-summary ": "Lesson 1: An organizational culture that promotes exchanging opinions and pointing faults is the key to success There were times when GE’s lights weren’t shining so bright and Boeing was facing major turbulences. When Welch became the CEO of GE in the 80s, he took a lot of risks. Some parts were justified and brought plenty of revenue in. However, the success may have gotten to his head.  GE formed two branches: the one focusing on its core business, and another one that acted more like a bank for its customers. They lent risky credits, issued bonds and credit cards, and spent money in other risky businesses. As a result, GE created a bubble ready to pop. However, management effectiveness couldn’t be questioned.  The culture just didn’t permit it. The outcome? GE fell tremendously during the 2008 crisis. Luckily, Warren Buffett and the US government stepped in and saved it from bankruptcy. Boeing faced a similar story when they produced faulty 737 MAX airplanes that ended up crashing twice in 2019.   The major issue reported by employees was that management was chasing profits and not listening to the workers when they encountered problems. With so much arrogance and so many deals with Wall Street on the table at the top, who was taking care of the core business and the employees? No one, therefore Boeing collapsed.                            Lesson 2: In the race for money and status, executives often forget about a company’s core value and purpose Nowadays, companies often promote workplace security, values, and principles at the core of their business, and hide their greed for profits. Let’s take the example of Boeing once again. Obviously, this company magnate dominates the market in their industry and has met tremendous success.  Still, greed caught up with it, up to a point that Boeing’s executives were getting into shady deals with Wall Street, fixing books with the accounting department, pushing production just to meet targets, and keeping everything hidden from the public eye. Again, the fault begins with executives and the culture of canceling whistleblowers.   Greed plays a huge role in the downfall or dissolving of companies. Short-term profits can overshadow long-term prosperity and even cost lives. For example, in Boeing’s quest to compete with Airbus and push production of the 737 MAX, they deliberately failed to train pilots on the new features of the plane.   Even worse, they didn’t even try to let them know about these changes. The result was hundreds of lost lives, two crashed airplanes in 2019, and a declining stock followed by negative figures. The lesson here is to never let short-term profits take over the bigger picture and shadow the core values of your company.                      Lesson 3: Success comes with incremental changes, cutting costs healthily, and improving employee morale Some of the worst mistakes that CEOs of the biggest companies made revolved around greed, a profit-oriented mentality, not paying enough attention to the core values of their business, and doing too many changes at once. But now, let’s focus on the great deeds too!  For starters, a great company is defined by employees. When a business takes care of its staff, the staff takes care of the customers. Although it sounds simple in theory, practice beats everyone to it. Then, there’s the profit part. This subject shouldn’t be taboo, yet it also shouldn’t be over-pushed.   Profit is a result of cutting costs or increasing sales. When Welch took over GE, he made sure to do away with the unnecessary costs and let go of unwanted weights, and that was a good thing for the company.   When Boeing decided to cut on steps in the manufacturing process and let go of quality control managers, that was the beginning of the company’s downfall. Such cost cuts are negative and shouldn’t normally occur. Instead, a great company focuses on increasing profits from sales or healthy cut costs from unnecessary areas.",

        "Book-summary ": "Lesson 1: The formula for achievement is skill x effort, but to have a skill, to begin with, you’ll have to put in the hours This might not be new to you – but it looks like once again the masterminds of the world are praising the same thing: talent can only take you so far, and hard work is the true ability we have to work on. Larry King was a native communicator, and there’s no doubt about that. In fact, he admits it himself: words do come easy to him!  However, much like every successful person in their area of expertise, Larry put in the hours and mastered his gift. As psychology and common wisdom suggest, without hard work and consistent input, talent means nothing in the long run. Therefore, talent and effort turn a gift into a skill.   A skill perfected with effort turns into achievement. Still, talent is not as important as you may think. Sure, natural inclinations do offer a starting point way above the general line. However, to make it to the top, everybody must run the same marathon.   Success isn’t a sprint, so it’s all about consistency in your daily endeavors. With a lot of hard work and continuous improvement, anyone can master the art of communication or anything else! If you want to pick up an activity, yet lack the native inclinations towards it, now you know how little that counts in the greater picture.                                Lesson 2: Talking means not listening, and not listening means not learning To become a great communicator, you’ll first have to become a great listener. Even the most gifted person must study the basic principles of their field before they jump straight to business. Moreover, when we listen, we learn, and that’s essential! Talking won’t teach you anything new, will it?  Listening is crucial to enhancing communication. However, listening is an art and science itself. Not all people all talkative, and not everyone wants to share information with you. To become a good listener, you’ll have to develop this ability first. Asking the right questions is a great start.   Avoid yes or no questions, and opt for more open-ended ones instead. Nod as your interlocutor speaks and ask questions to show that you’re interested. The more you ask, the more you’ll find out, as your listener is persuaded to communicate with you.   Moreover, it’s particularly important to maintain eye contact as you talk with someone. Looking in other directions, checking the time, on your phone, or shifting attention altogether will inhibit the conversation and undo the progress you’ve made.                           Lesson 3: If you love your job, you’ll find pleasure in work You’ve probably heard this saying before: if you love your job, you’ll never work a day in your life. Well, it’s true. The secret behind loving your job is to have it emerge out of passion. Larry King loved words, and so he became a radio and television host. Needless to say, he was quite successful in his life.  However, the idea behind loving your job is more complex than that. Passion itself isn’t the main ingredient of the secret sauce. What makes you stand out and do the work right is enthusiasm. This emotion drives the passion, the work, the extra input, the long hours, and whatnot.  When you do something out of enthusiasm, you win in life. Enthusiasm is rechargeable, it’s contagious for the team around you and fuels great work. Therefore, if you want to become a great communicator, speak with enthusiasm. If you want to simply attract people, be enthusiastic about your work, whichever that is.",

        "Book-summary ": "Lesson 1: A successful long-term strategy of an institution usually includes endowments Many organizations around the world, whether they’re public institutions, universities or colleges, charities or trusts, or even NGOs, have endowments that ensure their long-term success. An endowment is a donation received by an institution from an individual or another institution, which has to be kept under the receiving organization’s ownership for as long as they function.  Although the receiving organization can benefit from an endowment through interest or other financial benefits that may arise, the endowment can’t be sold, so as to ensure the perpetuating prosperity of the organization.  For example, an alumnus donated 96 acres of land to Yale in 1996, which is considered an endowment. Reaping the benefits, such as interest, helps Yale keep their financial status in great parameters. Although they are crucial for long-term success, some people may not rush when it comes to accepting endowments.  The uncomfortable aspect of receiving them as an institution is that the donor may require the organization to carry out research in different fields upon request, use the funds in a certain way, or take certain decisions that may not appeal to the executives of the enterprise. For this reason, not all donations go through as endowments.                               Lesson 2: When investing, you must take into consideration three core aspects A wise investor knows that in order to get on top of the game, they must invest in a smart way. That means considering the risk factor, the time frame, the securities they bet on, and many other crucial aspects. In fact, an investment analysis starts with three core aspects:  Asset allocation Market timing Security selection Asset allocation implies picking the classes of assets that you’ll be investing in. This factor is the most important when it comes to forecasting returns. The second aspect, which is market timing, refers to seizing opportunities in the market based on current events.   In the long strategy of an investor, there are moments to buy, moments to hold, and moments to sell. Market timing is all about that, and it can help investors pick security on discounts or avoid buying overpriced ones. Lastly, there’s the security selection.   Here an investor decides if they’re going to be active or passive in their approach. A passive investor mimics the market and does not actively pick or trade their securities in the short-term or long-term strategy, because the market returns a higher average than most investors can on their own. Therefore a passive strategy is more successful in highly efficient markets (bonds, stocks).   In contrast, active investors do their own research and pick their securities according to certain parameters. They do this in the hope to gain a higher than average return on investments. However, the active approach is advised for real estate markets, private equity, venture capital, or any investment that must usually be picked individually.                    Lesson 3: Diversifying your portfolio is one of the most powerful principles of investing Way too often, investors jump in too early or too late in the market. Or they invest only in highly-traded, increasingly popular securities because their peers do too. Unfortunately, this approach to investing has left many people and institutions with their empty pockets hanging.   Instead, the key to success is a long-term vision and a diversified portfolio. As mentioned before one of the core aspects of investing is asset allocation. Among the different types of securities, an investor or an institution must choose different asset classes and allocate funds accordingly.   A well-balanced portfolio usually includes stocks, bonds, and real estate, all from domestic, foreign, and private markets. Due to the fact that markets fluctuate and drop in value at times, it’s best not to have “all your eggs in one basket”. Allocating funds to various asset classes will ensure that your net worth fluctuates as little as possible while increasing at a steady pace.   A good rule of thumb between investors is not to allocate belfow 5-10% to a single class of assets. Why? Because it won’t affect your overall performance. Don’t allocate above 25-30% either. Doing so can hold too much of your net value blocked in case of a crash.",

        "Book-description ": "The definitive inside story of WeWork, its audacious founder, and what the company's epic unraveling exposes about Silicon Valley's delusions and the financial system's desperate hunger to cash in--from the Wall Street Journal reporters whose scoops hastened the company's downfall.  In 2001, Adam Neumann arrived in New York after five years as a conscript in the Israeli navy. Just over fifteen years later, he had transformed himself into the charismatic CEO of a company worth $47 billion--at least on paper. With his long hair and feel-good mantras, the 6-foot-five Neumann, who grew up in part on a kibbutz, looked the part of a messianic Silicon Valley entrepreneur. The vision he offered was mesmerizing: a radical reimagining of work space for a new generation, with its fluid jobs and lax office culture. He called it WeWork. Though the company was merely subleasing amenity-filled office space to freelancers and small startups, Neumann marketed it like a revolutionary product--and investors swooned.  As billions of funding dollars poured in, Neumann's ambitions grew limitless. WeWork wasn't just an office space provider, he boasted. It would build schools, create WeWork cities, even colonize Mars. Could he, Neumann wondered from the ice bath he'd installed in his office, become the first trillionaire or a world leader? In pursuit of its founder's grandiose vision, the company spent money faster than it could bring it in. From his private jet, sometimes clouded with marijuana smoke, the CEO scoured the globe for more capital. In late 2019, just weeks before WeWork's highly publicized IPO, a Hail Mary effort to raise cash, everything fell apart. Neumann was ousted from his company--but still was poised to walk away a billionaire.  Calling to mind the recent demise of Theranos and the hubris of the dotcom era bust, WeWork's extraordinary rise and staggering implosion were fueled by disparate characters in a financial system blind to its risks, from a Japanese billionaire with designs on becoming the Warren Buffet of tech, to leaders at JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs who seemed intoxicated by a Silicon Valley culture where sensible business models lost out to youthful CEOs who promised disruption. Why did some of the biggest names in banking and venture capital buy the hype? And what does the future hold for Silicon Valley unicorns? Wall Street Journal reporters Eliot Brown and Maureen Farrell explore these questions in this definitive account of WeWork's unraveling.",

        "Book-summary ": "Lesson 1: Knowing how to sell your dream can open remarkable doors in life Undoubtedly, Adam Neumann was a great communicator and knew how to sell his pitch. Back in 2006, he met Miguel McKelvey, who later became the co-founder of WeWork. Miguel never wanted to get massively rich. However, Adam was convincing enough to make him say yes to the crazy journey they were about to embark on.   At first, they sold ready-to-go offices for tech companies and freelancers. While profitable, they sold their stake to the landlord shortly. It was time to expand and look for new offices to rent. After pitching their startup to Joel Schreiber by saying it was worth $45 million, the investor bought one-third of the business for $15 million.   Later, they were presenting themselves as a tech startup offering renting services as a means to increase their valuation to venture capitalists. Neumann was comparing the company to a real-life Facebook, and himself as the new Steve Jobs. Everybody was hooked, and so WeWork quickly expanded in Europe and Asia.   Naturally, the two lost the pace of development, so Miguel opted out. But Neumann continued to seek insane growth. So he went to ask for funding from Softbank’s CEO, Masayoshi Son, which he received. In fact, Softbank valued the company at $47 billion, and American capitalists weren’t too far from this valuation figure either.                      Lesson 2: Always plan growth strategically and never lose sight of your business’s core values The problem with WeWork is that Neumann was looking to expand at a pace way beyond his powers. The founders expanded in Europe and Asia. And this was before they fully established the business and had well-set procedures in place. The hype continued to a point that people were investing in this company without taking the time to research it.  In fact, WeWork was looking to create a modern workplace, such as Google’s, where you can benefit from free food (vegan options included), free gym, happy hours, and so on. Naturally, the company wasn’t making any profits and was in fact losing one million dollars per day.   The other problem was the expansion in many markets. Offering so many complimentary services made everyone forget the core business model, which was to offer offices for people to work in. The biggest awe of them all is that both investors and institutions such as American or Asian banks failed to notice the faults in the business, up to a certain point.  Neumann was so brilliant at painting a bright future and coming up with expansion plans, that everyone overlooked the core aspects of WeWork and jumped straight to investing. All these aspects led to a fatal ending for WeWork, which was exposed in 2019 with the company’s valuations dropping billions overnight.                   Lesson 3: In business, ration must always dominate against emotions Adam Neumann was starting to have megalomaniacal ideas regarding WeWork. He sought to diversify the business activities, enter new markets, and offer complementary services. He also wanted 20-to-1 voting power, which was approved.  However, when Softbank cut off the funding, the company had to find a new source of financial aid. So they filed an IPO prospectus. WeWork went public on the 19th of August 2019, and what followed was a disaster. The entire financial world mocked the company, and Neumann stepped down from the board shortly.  Essentially, his ego and desire to expand too fast were the most prominent aspects of his downfall, which is why it’s important to keep your mind clear and always use strategic thinking in business. While work-life balance is important, a good leader treats his company with extreme care and doesn’t just party with every occasion, as Neumann did.",

        "Book-summary ": "Lesson 1: A target audience and a buyer persona are essential to any business’s marketing strategy. When building a marketing strategy, there are plenty of aspects to consider. It all starts with who you want to address and how you want your get your message across. To figure out how your marketing campaign should begin, you’ll have to look at your target audience, and more specifically, at your ideal client.   A target audience consists of the market you want to address. To define it, you’ll have to consider its demographical, social, economical, and behavioral factors. In the process of defining your buyer persona, you can ask these questions:  Where is this person located?  What’s their average income? What do they like to see and hear? What’s their gender?  Where can they be found? These are just some ideas of questions that you can implement in your target market study. Generally, what you need to do is answer as many questions as possible to narrow down your target audience. Then, it’ll be easier to come up with your ideal client figure, or your buyer persona.  When you have an approximate figure of your ideal customer, targeting your marketing efforts gets much easier. If you know who you’re speaking to, it’s easier to design the right campaign and have your prospects relate to your message and feel like you’re really speaking to them and not just trying to sell them something.                    Lesson 2: People connect easier to a character than a simple company. If you want to scale your brand and take it to the next level, you’ll have to find your way into the minds and hearts of your prospects. To do so, many companies create characters that their audience can connect to.   Those characters must be someone people can relate to, share struggles and find things in common with. Moreover, the character has to be someone that has flaws just like them and has opinions about important life matters.   The elements of an attractive character are:  A good story  A catchy, ongoing tale  Natural defects Popularity  A good story is all about where your character is coming from and how he or she is associated with the product. Your catchy tale means speaking through parables, or easy-to-remember stories that illustrate life situations. They can be common struggles, inspiring tales, or anything that gets your reader’s attention.  The defects of your character make it look human and flawed, and help your audience connect to it easily. Popularity comes in time, but once you have it, make sure to exploit it. Don’t be afraid to speak up, even if you’re offending someone. It’s better to please the right group than to stay neutral with everyone.                   Lesson 3: Build your online marketing campaign around the value ladder and the sales funnel. Marketing may seem like an ambiguous topic. A marketing campaign is even vaguer to some people. We know that we use marketing to advertise and ultimately sell more, but what counts as advertising? And how do we do it successfully?  According to the author, we can do that through a value ladder that ultimately turns into a sales funnel. A value ladder is a way of providing added value incrementally to your customers, in hope that they will go through each step of the ladder and pay for the experience as they go.   To build a successful value ladder, you need to give away less expensive front-end offers and attract leads to the most expensive offers eventually. You need to start by offering your prospects free knowledge and earning their trust. Only then you can pitch your offering and request payments.   A sales funnel is a web page representation of your value ladder. It is the process your audience goes through before buying your offerings. Funnel stages have different psychologies, so you need to speak to your front-end users in another manner than you would with your back-end users.",

        "Book-description": "From the authors of the #1 New York Times best seller Designing Your Life (\"Life has questions. They have answers\" --The NYT)--a job-changing, outlook-changing, life-changing book that shows us how to transform our work lives and create a dream job that is meaningful without necessarily changing the job we have.  Dysfunctional Belief: I'm stuck in a lousy situation (and there's nothing I can do about it). Reframe: I'm stuck in a lousy situation (and I'm finding the problems and the solutions). Bill Burnett and Dave Evans successfully taught graduate and undergraduate students at Stanford University and readers of their best-selling book, Designing Your Life (\"The prototype for a happy life.\" --Brian Lehrer, NPR), that designers don't analyze, worry, think, complain their way forward; they build their way forward. In Designing Your Work Life, Burnett and Evans show us how design thinking can transform our present job and our experience of work in general by utilizing the designer mindsets: Curiosity. Reframing. Radical collaboration. Awareness. Bias to action. Storytelling. Dysfunctional Belief: Good enough isn't good enough. Reframe: Good enough is GREAT--for now. Burnett and Evans show us how, with tools, tips, and ideas, to enjoy what we have and to live in a state of \"good enough, for now,\" one of the strongest, most effective reframes there is, and how this idea, once understood and accepted, can make new possibilities available, giving us the energy to enjoy the present moment and allowing us to begin to prototype possible futures. And if we want to quit? Burnett and Evans show us how to use the job we have to get the job we want (in another company), and show us as well, the art and science of quitting (leave the campsite better than we found it), using the power of the quit design to reframe how we finish our current job and get a better one.",

        "Book-summary": "Lesson 1: Enjoy the journey and aim for more in your career only when it makes sense for your life. You may not be able to change your current position. But you are always free to choose an option that suits you better. The most important thing is to be happy, whatever job you are doing. It’s very common for employees to be stuck in a rut. So we’ll explore ways to get out of it without having to change your life drastically.   Our lives are complicated, our work is complicated, and the best way to deal with this is to create a set of guiding principles that make your values clear. This won’t always make your days smoother, but it will give you something constant to hold on to.  Instead of always aiming for more of everything (money, status, possessions, relationships, etc.) simply allow yourself to enjoy the journey and the position you find yourself in. The main issue with always wanting more is that you can’t really ever achieve your end goal with that. You’ll always want more.   This concept is commonly known as the “hedonic treadmill”. Essentially, it’s when you get so much pleasure from getting what you want that you repeat this experience over and over again, getting stuck on a treadmill instead of enjoying life.                       Lesson 2: Work on becoming a life reframer by redesigning your work. Only you can decide whether your job is good enough. You might not be able to find a ‘dream job’ right away, but you can learn how to design your work life. You can choose the aspects of your life that are most important to you and make sure those are aligned with your career.   The authors call this concept reframing, and it implies changing your perspective on your job. Think of the tasks that you enjoy most doing and try to focus your work on those. Redesign your job to work best for you, instead of running away from it.   Start by reframing your job into three parts: money, impact, and expression. Naturally, each and every job is a mix between these three aspects, so you just have to figure out which ratio between these is right for you. The money part is clear. The impact is related to your social contribution, and expression of your creativity.   Once you figure out the right mix, start redesigning your dream job. Ask yourself if you’re satisfied, or if not, what’s the one thing you’d like to do more or get involved with? Adjust and start small, to see what works. If money is not a big component, you could even try going part-time and exploring your creativity during your free time off.                       Lesson 3: Use the ARC formula to rediscover motivation in your work life. There’s no such thing as an enjoyable workplace where you are not stressed and you look forward to 100% of the time. Social media, friends, TV, and other sources of information can sometimes paint a bright picture when it comes to our professional life, making people feel like they’re doing something wrong for not feeling absolute joy at all times.   The problem starts at our motivation level, and that’s an internal issue to fix. Start by accepting that work may not always be a dream environment, and that’s ok. However, you can make it more challenging, enjoyable, and fun. How? By using the ARC method. Here’s what it stands for:  A – autonomy  R – relatedness C – competence  Autonomy is the level of freedom you get to redesign your work life. You can increase autonomy by overdelivering and therefore improving your basic tasks. If your task is to work with a system, try upgrading it and making it more challenging while delivering added value.   Relatedness comes with the connections you make and the energy you get from working with other like-minded people. Enjoy more of this feeling by reaching out to colleagues, trying out new projects, and connecting at the workplace.   Lastly, competence implies the set of skills you need to perform your job. We’re all great at certain tasks while avoiding the ones we don’t do well. However, when you encounter new projects or areas of work where you don’t feel comfortable, simply tell yourself that it’s a great way to develop skills and gain new insights.",

        "Book-description": "The Wall Street Journal bestseller—a Financial Times Business Book of the Month and named by The Washington Post as “One of the 11 Leadership Books to Read in 2018”—is “a refreshingly data-based, clearheaded guide” (Publishers Weekly) to individual performance, based on a groundbreaking study. Why do some people perform better at work than others? This deceptively simple question continues to confound professionals in all sectors of the workforce. Now, after a unique, five-year study of more than 5,000 managers and employees, Morten Hansen reveals the answers in his “Seven Work Smarter Practices” that can be applied by anyone looking to maximize their time and performance. Each of Hansen’s seven practices is highlighted by inspiring stories from individuals in his comprehensive study. You’ll meet a high school principal who engineered a dramatic turnaround of his failing high school; a rural Indian farmer determined to establish a better way of life for women in his village; and a sushi chef, whose simple preparation has led to his unassuming restaurant being awarded the maximum of three Michelin stars. Hansen also explains how the way Alfred Hitchcock filmed Psycho and the 1911 race to become the first explorer to reach the South Pole both illustrate the use of his seven practices. Each chapter “is intended to inspire people to be better workers…and improve their own work performance” (Booklist) with questions and key insights to allow you to assess your own performance and figure out your work strengths, as well as your weaknesses. Once you understand your individual style, there are mini-quizzes, questionnaires, and clear tips to assist you focus on a strategy to become a more productive worker. Extensive, accessible, and friendly, Great at Work will help us “reengineer our work lives, reduce burnout, and improve performance and job satisfaction” (Psychology Today).",

        "Book-summary ": "Lesson 1: Being successful doesn’t imply working overtime and risking burnout. Many of us believe the key to success is working hard and putting in long hours day after day. After he graduated, Morten Hansen was one of these people.  For some years he worked 60-90 hours per week and neglected his private life and health. That was until he discovered his teammate Nathalie had better results than him and never left the office after 6 p.m. or worked on weekends.  Despite Hansen’s experience, the overworked, stressed-out, high-achiever paradigm is still a stereotype often portrayed in movies. These individuals neglect their personal concerns for business interests. However, Hansen’s research shows that you don’t have to voluntarily give up your time away from work to get great results. You can do it while maintaining work-life balance!  His team discovered that the main feature of top performers is selectivity. While most productivity experts suggest prioritizing, Hansen goes beyond. If you want to excel, he says, you need to evaluate carefully which activities are worth your time.  Top performers apply the “do less, then obsess” principle. They are very selective about goals, ideas, and collaborations. Once they have chosen to undertake a specific project, they commit to producing high-quality work.                                                       Lesson 2: Do what you love with purpose, even if it means redesigning your work, and never stop learning. Hansen’s research has brought some unexpected findings.  A popular assumption is that you can achieve greatness only by doing what you love. The author even confirms that people passionate about their jobs are more likely to perform better.  But fascination alone doesn’t suffice. Only people who adopt the “P-squared approach” and match passion with purpose do perform great.  We need to feel useful. We can do our best only if we find a role that provides value to other people, thus experiencing satisfaction and well-being at work. The very best performers in the study rethought their work to create the most value. Some designed new roles for themselves, while others launched a new business inside their current company.  Morten Hansen has also questioned the popular idea that you need to practice for 10,000 hours to master a skill. He says that’s not what top performers do. The best way to become smarter while working is to apply the “learning loop.” Regularly ask for feedback about what you do and use it to fine-tune your processes.  Never give up learning while working! Even if you need to accomplish the same activities every day, explore new ways of doing them. This is the “Quality learning” principle: avoid mindless repetitions to keep improving your skills.                                                                                             Lesson 3: Collaborate only when useful and hold effective meetings using the “Fight and unite” method. We consider collaboration to be efficient, and we often think the more, the better. Experts advise organizations to eliminate silos, build networks, and use lots of high-tech communication tools.  But top performers collaborate less, not more. They do work together only if it provides value to the projects of themselves and their potential associates. Otherwise, they save time and energy for more productive activities.  What about when you need to utilize a team? How can you manage meetings to get the most from them? Top performers suggest that you carefully analyze if a meeting is really necessary before organizing one. If it is, be sure that time together provides the highest value using the “fight and unite” approach.  To be effective, you need to get your team to debate. People must feel allowed to speak their mind. Confrontation is essential for the most innovative ideas to emerge and for sound decision making. Debating requires different points of view, so you’ll have the best results if you bring together people with more diverse backgrounds and mindsets.  You also need to ask specific questions to get your teammates to express themselves freely. Rather than “Do we have any new ideas?” ask: “What can we do to improve this service?” Despite contrary opinions, the team must unite. Make sure each member commits to implementing the decision-making process and to respecting whatever choices the team leader will make.

        "Book-summary": "Lesson 1: All habits are based on a four-step pattern, which consists of cue, craving, response, and reward. In 1776, Adam Smith laid the foundation of modern economics in his magnum opus, The Wealth of Nations. One of his most famous observations is that, in a free market system, all workers naturally maximize their own society’s welfare, even if merely acting in their own best interest:  “…he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention.”  When it comes to habits, James suggests that environment is the invisible hand that shapes human behavior. That’s why a prompt is always the first step in performing any habit. It may not always be external, but, most of the time, it will be. Then, three more stages follow to complete the four-step pattern:  Cue. A piece of information that suggests there’s a reward to be found, like the smell of a cookie or a dark room waiting to light up. Craving. The motivation to change something to get the reward, like tasting the delicious cookie or being able to see. Response. Whatever thought or action you need to take to get to the reward. Reward. The satisfying feeling you get from the change, along with the lesson whether to do it again or not. There are several popular methodologies that try to predict how and why we do what we do, such as Charles Duhigg’s habit loop, Gretchen Rubins four tendencies, or BJ Fogg’s Tiny Habits behavior model. James offers a more refined version of what Duhigg described in The Power of Habit and while all of these approaches are different, none of them are mutually exclusive.                             Lesson 2: To form habits, you must make them obvious, attractive, easy, and satisfying. From the four-step pattern he suggests, James then derives four laws of behavior change, which correspond to one part of the loop each. Here they are, along with some ideas for how you can use them to facilitate good behaviors and make bad ones harder:  Make it obvious. Don’t hide your fruits in your fridge, put them on display front and center. Make it attractive. Start with the fruit you like the most, so you’ll actually want to eat one when you see it. Make it easy. Don’t create needless friction by focusing on fruits that are hard to peel. Bananas and apples are super easy to eat, for example. Make it satisfying. If you like the fruit you picked, you’ll love eating it and feel healthier as a result! You can apply these to all kinds of good habits, like running, working on a side project, spending more time with family, and so on. Conversely, do the opposite for bad habits. Make them invisible, unattractive, difficult, and unsatisfying. For example, you could hide your cigarettes, add financial penalties, get rid of all lighters, and only allow yourself to smoke outside in the cold.                               Lesson 3: A habit tracker is a fun and easy way to ensure you stick to your new behaviors. With a framework like this, making and breaking habits becomes fun. You’ll likely want to tackle multiple things sooner rather than later, but it’s important to not take on too much at once. An easy way of keeping yourself accountable without becoming overwhelmed is to track your habits with a habit tracker.  The idea is simple: You keep a record of all the behaviors you want to establish or abandon and, at the end of each day, you mark which ones you succeeded with. This record can be a single piece of paper, a journal, a calendar, or a digital tool, like an app.  This strategy is based on what’s sometimes called the Seinfeld productivity hack. Comedian Jerry Seinfeld apparently marked his calendar with a big ‘X’ every day he came up with a joke. Soon, his goal was to not break the chain. It’s a simple, but effective strategy to help you build good habits.  And since habits are the compound interest of self-improvement, that’s a process we should all start today. ",

        "Book-summary": "The criteria used to evaluate the three dimensions are very interesting. Let’s start with culture: the author identifies Teamwork as the key way to ensure a strong culture. Strive to make all of your employees feel like they’re part of a valuable team, and results will follow. A second identified element is Purpose: if you try to actively show to your employees the direct impact of all the hard work they do, and are then able to connect this work back to your organization’s core values, the results can be astounding.  The second element is around Technology. here the idea is simple: as people are more and more acquainted with consumer technology at home, they will use that to measure all applications that the company offers. Anything that increases complexity at work is judged negatively. The answer is to involve users in the choice of technology, avoiding the continuing dropping of new tools, and investing instead time on adoption.  The third element is Physical Space, which often is overlooked in many experience analysis. However, the time spent in the workplace means that a big part of our experience is linked to the way space is designed and “fits” our lives. The author fails to really address the design of spaces, but allows some good insights on work flexibility and workplace attributes.  I believe that this book has had the important virtue of being the first to frame a logical concept of experience grounded in physical and not just cultural terms. And has also built a strong link with the way individuals perceive their working experience and the results of a company.                     In the remainder of the book Morgan identifies a number of important elements required to intentionally design good employees experiences. I have already covered most of these elements in the recent post on Design Thinking. The main concept is the identification of Moments that Matter, which in the author intention is the change of perspective from Lifecycles (which employees don’t really understand) to identify what really matters for the individuals. The second vital concept is that Employee Experience is not just an HR problem. HR can be a strong contributor in the design process, but it is everyone’s responsibility to champion the concept within the organisation. Managers need to create a culture of open feedback, and employees need to be open and honest about what works and what doesn’t, to create positive circles of influence.",

        "Book-description": "Franz Kafka, frustrated with his living quarters and day job, wrote in a letter to Felice Bauer in 1912, “time is short, my strength is limited, the office is a horror, the apartment is noisy, and if a pleasant, straightforward life is not possible then one must try to wriggle through by subtle maneuvers.”   Kafka is one of 161 inspired—and inspiring—minds, among them, novelists, poets, playwrights, painters, philosophers, scientists, and mathematicians, who describe how they subtly maneuver the many (self-inflicted) obstacles and (self-imposed) daily rituals to get done the work they love to do, whether by waking early or staying up late; whether by self-medicating with doughnuts or bathing, drinking vast quantities of coffee, or taking long daily walks. Thomas Wolfe wrote standing up in the kitchen, the top of the refrigerator as his desk, dreamily fondling his “male configurations”. . . Jean-Paul Sartre chewed on Corydrane tablets (a mix of amphetamine and aspirin), ingesting ten times the recommended dose each day . . . Descartes liked to linger in bed, his mind wandering in sleep through woods, gardens, and enchanted palaces where he experienced “every pleasure imaginable.”  Here are: Anthony Trollope, who demanded of himself that each morning he write three thousand words (250 words every fifteen minutes for three hours) before going off to his job at the postal service, which he kept for thirty-three years during the writing of more than two dozen books . . . Karl Marx . . . Woody Allen . . . Agatha Christie . . . George Balanchine, who did most of his work while ironing . . . Leo Tolstoy . . . Charles Dickens . . . Pablo Picasso . . .

Here also are the daily rituals of Charles Darwin, Andy Warhol, John Updike, Twyla Tharp, Benjamin Franklin, William Faulkner, Jane Austen, Anne Rice, and Igor Stravinsky (he was never able to compose unless he was sure no one could hear him and, when blocked, stood on his head to “clear the brain”).",

        "Book-summary": "Lesson 1: Inspiration can come from anything, from daily rituals, a warm drink, or a sunset. There are certain things that artists, thinkers, or overall successful people in their field have in common. While they don’t do these things similarly, they do repeat certain actions that help them become more productive.   One of them is working at a certain time during the day. Some artists prefer working at night, while others rely on the daytime to do things. Find your best time and try to focus on work as much as possible during those hours. The other way people become productive is by consuming certain drinks, like coffee.  Beethoven and Mozart were both known for drinking large amounts of coffee to become productive. While the book recommends staying away from too much of everything, and completely avoiding dangerous substances, it’s alright if you indulge in cups of tea or coffee to get in the mood for work.  These accomplished people usually enjoyed such treats in their favorite spot right before work, which is also psychologically proven to boost efficiency. Our brain associates these actions with a prework sort of workout that gets us in the mood.  Lastly, writers and researchers often look for inspiration within their surroundings. They try to draw inspiration from a sunrise, plants, animals, or other elements from natural words. People that are close to you can also help you get into the mood for work. So make sure to surround yourself with these types of humans.                                  Lesson 2: There are numerous ways to get inspired and stay connected to your craft. The book talks about different authors and their ways of staying close to their craft, becoming inspired, and writing effectively. Some found peace and motivation in nature, so they’d take long walks until inspiration struck them. Then they’d rush home to create and design their pieces.  Others found that sexual intercourse or pleasure derived from bodily functions gives them enough inspiration to write for days. Baths or long showers also seemed to be popular choices for some authors. The point is, that everyone has different ways of becoming connected to themselves and becoming inspired.  As a writer, it can be challenging to start creating out of thin air and seeing a blank page can be that much more demoralizing. For this reason, you have to find what can help you get in the mood for work and practice that when you feel like you’re lacking motivation.  Lastly, keep in mind that there’s no wrong or right in the creative process. Everyone gets inspired or works on their craft in their particular way. What worked for these people might not prove to be efficient for you, but that’s alright. The point is to find your muse! Whether it means working during the day or night, drinking coffee, taking a shower, or anything at all.                               Lesson 3: Your connections to the people in your life can make or break your creative mind. Any social science in the world can agree on one common fact: Our relationships define us and they also affect our mood. They are the pylon of our social life and they strongly impact our mental health. Friends, partners, parents, and other family members, all have a great impact on our work.  Keeping relationships in good parameters and also nurturing our ties with those we love keeps us in great mental and physical shape. The main point is to draw inspiration from these good ties and keep our souls at peace.   Authors have long relied on their partners for their well-being, treating them as a muse in the process of creation. It doesn’t come as a shock to find out that this is largely how many famous pieces of writing emerged.   Partners or friends can also help us with everyday chores and alleviate some of the pressure from mundane tasks. This way, you can append more time creating and designing your craft. You can see this type of relationship in the lives of Karl Marx, Immanuel Kant, Gustav Mahler, and many more.",

        "Author-name": "Cal Newport",
        "Book-description": "From New York Times bestselling author Cal Newport comes a bold vision for liberating workers from the tyranny of the inbox--and unleashing a new era of productivity.  Modern knowledge workers communicate constantly. Their days are defined by a relentless barrage of incoming messages and back-and-forth digital conversations--a state of constant, anxious chatter in which nobody can disconnect, and so nobody has the cognitive bandwidth to perform substantive work. There was a time when tools like email felt cutting edge, but a thorough review of current evidence reveals that the hyperactive hive mind workflow they helped create has become a productivity disaster, reducing profitability and perhaps even slowing overall economic growth. Equally worrisome, it makes us miserable. Humans are simply not wired for constant digital communication.  We have become so used to an inbox-driven workday that it's hard to imagine alternatives. But they do exist. Drawing on years of investigative reporting, author and computer science professor Cal Newport makes the case that our current approach to work is broken, then lays out a series of principles and concrete instructions for fixing it. In A World without Email, he argues for a workplace in which clear processes--not haphazard messaging--define how tasks are identified, assigned and reviewed. Each person works on fewer things (but does them better), and aggressive investment in support reduces the ever-increasing burden of administrative tasks. Above all else, important communication is streamlined, and inboxes and chat channels are no longer central to how work unfolds.  The knowledge sector's evolution beyond the hyperactive hive mind is inevitable. The question is not whether a world without email is coming (it is), but whether you'll be ahead of this trend. If you're a CEO seeking a competitive edge, an entrepreneur convinced your productivity could be higher,",

        "Book-summary ": "Lesson 1: Instant messaging and emailing can decrease productivity drastically in the workplace. Everyone uses emails at work – it’s just the way things are right now. Emails keep us connected and enhance collaboration within teams. Sounds good? That’s what the companies thought. However, it seems that communication through inboxes might do more harm than good.   On average, a worker checks their email every six minutes. One-third of our working day is spent navigating inboxes, and the average knowledge worker does an hour and 15 minutes of productive work a day, according to a study conducted by RescueTime.  The main reason behind these demotivating numbers is that emails and notifications became like an addiction to us. And organizational cultures are pushing them to keep the collaborative flow going and increase responsiveness. The intention behind this concept is good, but in practice, it kills productivity.   That is because we are wired to only focus on one thing at a time. And keeping many tabs open and working with information in the back of our mind just doesn’t sit well with the prefrontal cortex. The result? Decreased attention, a lack of focus, and increased stress levels.                            Lesson 2: To improve productivity, we have to switch to project management execution apps instead of emails. Emails are outdated project assignation tools, and for a reason. They decrease the attention span by keeping employees hooked to a constantly open tab. Not only that, but they also get messy and unstructured.  Instead, business thinkers like Peter Drucker have better ideas when it comes to improving the workflow. Drucker acknowledged two types of work: the knowledge workers and the factory-type workers.   Factory-type workers are most efficient when they divide their work into smaller chunks and are responsible for their own small area of activity. With knowledge workers, things get a bit more complicated, because you can’t tell them how to be creative, but you can’t monitor them and inhibit their creative thinking.   However, what you can do is interfere with the way they do things or their framework. Apps like Trello or Flow are specialized in assigning tasks and they limit the use of email to a great extent. This is great news because as we all know, emails do inhibit productivity.   Make sure to include employees in the workflow change and give them autonomy in their decisions. Always double-check with them to see if they like and agree with the changes and what tasks they’d like to receive.                           Lesson 3: People work best when they receive straightforward, coordinated tasks. Emails are a great means of communication, but what happens when we don’t know what to communicate? Most of the time, they get in the way of productivity. The problem with emails is that people feel productive writing and reading them when they’re in fact not productive at all.  Many times over management agents noticed how people pass around tasks and explanations because no one really knows how to deal with them. Responsibilities are often misassigned, unaligned with deadlines or objectives, or ambiguous for the receiving end.   For this reason, team members assign them between each other and spend precious working hours moving tasks around, without actually following up on them or getting things done. This phenomenon boils down to one solution: assigning employees straightforward, structured, organized tasks.   Every employee should receive work that they perceive easy to understand, follow up on, and get done. A deadline is an effective way to set standards of operation, while an “open door policy” is always a great idea to encourage communication. The best way to set these aspects in place is through management apps that deliver.",

        "Book-description": "This international bestseller challenges everything you thought you knew about the requirements for strategic success.  Since the dawn of the industrial age, companies have engaged in head-to-head competition in search of sustained, profitable growth. They have fought for competitive advantage, battled over market share, and struggled for differentiation. Yet, as this influential and immensely popular book shows, these hallmarks of competitive strategy are not the way to create profitable growth in the future.  In the international bestseller Blue Ocean Strategy, W. Chan Kim and Renee Mauborgne argue that cutthroat competition results in nothing but a bloody red ocean of rivals fighting over a shrinking profit pool. Based on a study of 150 strategic moves (spanning more than 100 years across 30 industries), the authors argue that lasting success comes not from battling competitors, but from creating \"blue oceans\"—untapped new market spaces ripe for growth. Such strategic moves, which the authors call “value innovation,” create powerful leaps in value that often render rivals obsolete for more than a decade.",

        "Book-summary": "Lesson 1: Instead of competing in a Red Ocean, learn to dive deep into the Blue Ocean. The book brings forth two types of markets, namely the Red and Blue Oceans. The first type of market is the battlefield of businesses, the place where they practice their operational activities, look for new sources to gain their competitive advantage, and pull the rug from each other’s feet.   This market is slightly nerve-wracking, as it implies allocating many resources to fight rivals, find new ground to conquer, and always watching over your shoulder to see if others are doing the same. This is where small, medium, and large enterprises fight their battles and try to win over consumers.  The Blue Ocean is an entirely new, untapped territory where not a lot of companies end up operating. Why? Because ending up in the Blue Ocean implies that executives of the said company spend time innovating and creating new products or services that cannot compete with what’s already on the market.   In the Red Ocean, it is difficult to look for new sources of revenue and innovate. In the Blue Ocean, this is your primary focus. You take time off from the competition and focus solely on innovation. If you succeed, you’re likely going to win without even having to fight, and consumers will migrate towards the new trend set by you.                    Lesson 2: Arriving at a Blue Ocean implies a strategy canvas that allows you to win the competition. Every business will have to fight its battles in the Red Ocean, regardless of its industry. Competition is a natural part of every company’s environment and growth, but it’s up to its executives to come up with ways to tame it while focusing on innovation. In other words, you’ll need to swim in the Red Ocean till you reach the Blue one.  One way to do this is by applying the canvas suggested by the authors. This canvas consists of four essential questions to ask yourself before you jump into the Blue Ocean:  Which of the factors that the industry takes for granted should be eliminated? Which factors should be reduced well below industry standard? Which factors should you raise above industry standard? Which factors should be created that have never been offered? The first question tries to open up a space for companies to evaluate the services or products they offer that consumers don’t care about and that they should eliminate to grow margins and focus on innovation.   For example, low-cost airlines eliminated airport lounges and offered more flights, which in turn grew their figures and increased their support from consumers who wanted more frequent flights instead of better lounges.   The second question is similar, but it asks what you can focus on to be the best while reducing the focus on another aspect just enough to keep it going at the bare minimum. Be the best in your area, not in all areas. This takes us to the third question: what would that area be? Where are you more likely to succeed? Focus on that area. Finally, the fourth question is all about innovation, or the Blue Ocean.                             Lesson 3: Jump into the Blue Ocean and make your competition seem irrelevant. Reaching the Blue Ocean is a big step for every company, because not only will it assure your survival in the market, but also grow your enterprise successfully, at least for a brief time. Innovation is at the cornerstone of every business, industry, and advancement of a field.   Innovation is essential to improve our world. Moreover, consumers are always looking for better products and services, so whoever is the first to offer a newer, shinier, more spectacular invention is likely to grab the attention of the masses.   To start doing so you’ll have to invest many resources into R&D and switch your focus from your competition now, to your offerings in the future. Do so through value innovation, which is a concept that implies creating a leap in value for your consumers. When you do that you open new territory to explore for your buyers.  You can create added value by improving what you already have, which is great, but it won’t make your company stand out. The second way to improve your customers’ lives is to offer new, improved products. A strong company focuses on both approaches to win over its consumers.",

        "Book-summary": "Lesson 1: To become productive, you’ll have to start organizing your time according to the four quadrants. Struggling with procrastination is a real thing, and it all boils down to one main issue – we don’t know how to manage our time. What’s worse is that we think we’re good at doing so. That is why we also reject scientific methods and advice on the matter, thinking that we know better.   Let’s debunk this once and for all – you’re never going to move past your recurring procrastination without a system. A time management system can help you organize your tasks more efficiently and finally get things done. Let’s start with the four quadrants so you get a better idea of what I’m talking about.  The four quadrants of your time are:  Q1 – which includes your important and urgent work. (E.g. emergencies) Q2  – which includes important, but non-urgent tasks (E.g. work, preparing for meetings, etc.) – this is where you want to spend most of your time  Q3 – which includes urgent but non-important work (E.g. checking emails) Q4 – which includes time spent on meaningless things (E.g. checking social media)  Carry out a self-analysis and think about where you spend most of your time. Your work day should imply a lot of Q2 time, less Q1 and Q3 time, and minimal Q4 time. Structure your work in these four quadrants. Every time you feel like doing something, ask yourself where your task fits in. That way, you’ll know how much time you should spend on it.                             Lesson 2: Define your role titles, your role statements, and your schedule to set better goals. By now you know that you should be spending most of your work time in Q2 doing important but non-urgent work. But what is that? Our jobs are complex and they require many tasks, so what’s important may seem blurry at times. Well, this is why you should define your role titles and statements.  Your role title is the main category of work you’ll be doing, while your role statement defines where you want to be. Let’s focus on an example: your role title can be “professional wedding planner’’, while your role statement may look like “I want to become the best wedding planner in town.”  This set of statements can help you start organizing your goals and your schedule. Now that you’ve defined them, you can start setting goals and objectives to achieve them step by step. Make sure to time-bound your goals so that you have a deadline to focus on. Then, it’s time to set your schedule.  Given a deadline, you now have to estimate how much time you can dedicate each day to meet that end goal. Let’s say you want to become the best wedding planner in town in one year. How much time will that take each month? What about every day? If it’s two hours a day, add that to your Q2 time daily to meet your criteria.                      Lesson 3: To reap all the benefits of a time management system, you’ll have to nurture your body and energy levels. Now that you’ve learned about the time management system presented in this book and got an idea of the strategies you need to use to implement it, it’s time to focus on the most important aspect of this system – you.   Without a body and a mind to hold everything together, even the most efficient time management book is useless. You need to sustain your energy levels and take care of your physic if you want to be consistent in this approach. If not, you’ll likely come across burnout, vitamin deficiencies, mental breakdowns, and whatnot.  Nowadays, our lives can get pretty busy and stressful. So making sure we’re keeping up with them is crucial for success. You can do so by nourishing your three sources of energy:  The powerful purpose (or the motivation/ satisfaction you get from work) The physical body (your overall health levels) The connections (your network and social life, your relationships with friends and family) Without these three sources of energy ticked, it’ll be impossible for you to become productive. For this reason, make sure to engage in purposeful work or even enroll in a charity program, to carry out a healthy lifestyle, and actively communicate with your close circle. ",

        "Book-summary": "Lesson 1: As humans, we must learn to control our perceptions about the world if we want to live purposefully. Stoicism is a philosophy that teaches us how to control our emotions and maintain emotional balance in all things. It is the practice of being able to achieve this state of emotional balance by training the mind to be objective, calm, and rational.  The three core principles of stoicism are perception, action and will. We must learn how to master perception first by understanding that we can never control anything external to ourselves. All we can do is control our thoughts, actions and reactions.   By mastering these things, we can achieve a greater level of happiness and satisfaction in life. You can’t control what happens to you, but you can control how you react to it by using your perceptions to guide your actions.  For example, imagine someone steals your prepacked meal from the common fridge at the workplace. You may be upset but that does not mean you have to be angry or spend all day complaining about it. Instead, you can choose how to react appropriately and objectively. Either let it go or place a formal complaint, but never worry without a purpose.                  Lesson 2: Work on controlling your actions, instead of letting them control you. Mastering a skill is not an easy feat, but learning about the stoic philosophy will help you become much calmer, centered, and aware of your actions. Then, you’ll be able to focus on objective perceptions, leave your biases behind, and act accordingly. Action is a core component of Stoicism after perception is formed.   This is because if your perception is in control, you are the one who is acting. But if your action is in control, then it’s like you are being acted upon. You should always be the actor behind every step of your life. Still, not every perception requires an action. What really should matter is the one thing that you can actively change.  A perception remains just that without action. Therefore, to master the skill of being a stoic, you must first analyze your thoughts. Note if they’re subjective and try to move objectively through the chain of thought. Then, dismiss them if you cannot find a way to change the situation. Naturally, there’s only so much you can act upon.  If someone says something mean about you, you’ll first form a perception about it. You’ll be angry, indifferent, or anything in between. Now, is there anything you can do about it? No – so there’s no need to act upon that. And there you have it – the Stoic philosophy applied.              Lesson 3: Will sticks with us when everything else fades. The third core concept of the Stoic philosophy is will. So far, we’ve explored how perception must be interpreted, changed, and how action is a result of it. Action is not always necessary, and it’s a powerful act that can change our life.  Will is an inner power that gets us through life’s bumpy rides. It’s the act of trying more or keeping hope alive, or pushing through hardship when life feels impossible. It also helps us see past the obstacle and build new, better ways from whatever sour lemons we’ve been thrown.   Will is often interpreted as an unbreakable ambition to make the impossible possible. While doing such things indeed comes from our inner force, stoics find will to be more about a sense of humility, resilience, and acceptance. Under the toughest hardships that life prepares for each and every one of us, it is will that helps us go through.   Both types of will are within us, but in times of true heartbreak, pain, and hurt from within, the silent will is our friend. When life sends us obstacles and challenges to bypass and grow stronger, ambitious will can take us farther. As humans, we have to discover these powers within ourselves and learn to harness them.",

        "Book-summary": "Lesson 1: Authentic happiness and fun don’t necessarily imply a fancy vacation, but a simple treat. According to the author, fun isn’t an activity, but a feeling. She remembers vividly her childhood memories and looks back at a much simple time with joy and nostalgia. While in Georgia, she used to snap beans with her mother and grandmother from dusk till dawn. The best part? Well, that was the best part!   The idea of doing nothing, enjoying the present moment, and living simply doesn’t sound complicated at all. And yet practice beats all of us to it. Perhaps that’s the reason we look back on our childhood with nostalgia and a feeling of good old joy. But what if we could restore these emotions and integrate them into our everyday lives?  The author suggests that enjoying the little things and doing more of those tiny activities that make us happy will do the trick. It might be enjoying a cup of hot chocolate, watering plants, riding a bicycle, or anything at all.   The idea is that happiness doesn’t come from future events, fancy trips, or expensive items. Rather, it comes from anything that makes you happy personally. Don’t take my word for it. Just look around: rich people often feel depressed regardless of their possessions. But children, people who live in the countryside, or simple families often get to know the highest of joys.                    Lesson 2: Fun starts right here, right now, so stop planting seeds for your future joy. The author has a valuable lesson for all of us: stop planting seeds for the future and start harvesting the ones you’ve been growing for so long. As a single woman, she constantly delayed her happiness for a future state of being where she’d be married to someone.  She didn’t buy a house, didn’t go on her dream trip to Europe, and more absurdly, she even delayed buying great coffee mugs, saving everything for a life shared in two. The problem? She was still in the dating phase, and after a rejection, her heart was broken. It was then that she went to an emotional retreat.   And then, it hit her. It was time to enjoy all these little things, have fun, and stop postponing happiness. The lesson here is that joy starts when you let go of your imagination and start living in the present moment. Take a moment as you’re reading this to acknowledge that you’re alive and be happy about it.   Count your blessings and start living joyfully, without waiting for some end goal to come true. Find pleasure in the little things while still working for what you desire in the future. Isn’t that a healthier approach to life? Life is a real thing, but our dream future isn’t, so stop living in it.               Lesson 3: Having fun is no excuse to deny your true feelings. Sometimes life sends hardships our way only to make us braver and stronger. During those difficult times, it may be hard to enjoy life and have fun. And the author knows it all too well. During a trip to Lone Valley, she felt as if she must have fun because everyone else does so.  The problem with fake smiling is that it makes us even sadder. Fortunately, the leader of the group saw through the smile and encouraged her to be vulnerable and feel her feelings. While the author didn’t suddenly let go of all her negative feelings, she felt at ease knowing that she can fully experience her inner world.   At times, it’s best to acknowledge what we truly feel and deal with that before we can enjoy life to its fullest. For this reason, she used the trip to deepen her connection with God, and acknowledge and feel her emotions, so by the time she went back home, her heart was at peace and she could experience fun again.  Another great aspect that the book highlights is the importance of having hobbies. In time, we often forget about our silly passions and leisure activities due to work and overbooked schedules. However, if we truly want to live happier days or deal with whatever is hurting us, hobbies can play a role in the process. ",

        "Book-summary": "Lesson 1: Controlling your emotions and manifesting your dream reality is what will make you successful. The book talks about how we attract what we focus on, whether it’s positive or negative. It also talks about how we need to improve our ways of thinking and doing things, so that we’re more aware of our limiting beliefs and change them for better outcomes.  The Law of Vibration states that your emotions have an effect on your reality. You can’t just manifest something—you need to believe in it and channel those emotions toward your dream. You can’t just wish for something; you have to feel it! This is how you will bring yourself closer to your goals and make them a reality.  If you’re spending your days with negative people, studies show that you too will feel and act in a negative way. You become who you spend your time with, so make sure to surround yourself with happy people. To increase confidence, the book shows that sitting in a straight pose for a minimum of 20-minutes per day should do it.  Body language is also extremely important in the process of improving yourself. Smiling and thinking positively, even if you don’t always feel like it, can help you become more joyous and activate the “feel-good” hormones. Another great cure for an impaired mind is spending time by yourself in nature.  Nature is known for its healing properties and for helping you achieve a higher frequency. For this reason, make sure to dedicate some quality time for self-care in nature once in a while. Forest bathing is a popular practice in this regard – and for a reason!                     Lesson 2: Setting boundaries can help you cut toxic people and work on yourself more. Setting boundaries means creating rules for yourself about what behaviors are acceptable and unacceptable in your relationships. This way, if someone steps out of bounds (i.e. acts like a jerk), then they’ll know what they did wrong and how to fix it next time around.  When it comes down to it, setting boundaries isn’t about hurting anyone else—it’s about taking care of yourself first. In the long run, people will respect you more and you’ll get to enjoy quality time by yourself without feeling bad.   It’s important to recognize when you’re feeling overwhelmed, or like you’re taking on too much. When this happens, it can be easy to let other people’s needs take precedence over yours—but if you don’t set boundaries around what’s okay for you, others will continue to take advantage of that generosity and exhaust you.  Let’s see how you can start setting boundaries in three simple steps:  Identify the situations that are causing you pain or stress. Figure out what you want for yourself in those situations. Decide how much time and energy you’re willing to put into making them better (or not). Setting boundaries isn’t just about cutting toxic people out of your life; it’s also about helping yourself grow as an individual. When we allow others to dictate how things go for us, we often end up feeling resentful toward those people, and we don’t get what we want out of life because we’re too busy trying to please them.                        Lesson 3: Learn to work on yourself, plant happy seeds in your mind, and enjoy your presence. In life, you can choose the way you want your mind to work for you. Let’s imagine, for a moment, that your beliefs are the seeds that take root in your unconscious mind. You either have helpful or unhelpful beliefs, which in turn lead to either a joyful, serene garden or a toxic wasteland.   To successfully change your reality, you need to weed out the bad seeds. In order to do this, you first need to recognize that you have limiting beliefs and then develop an awareness of how these beliefs are impacting your life.   Once you’ve done this, you can make changes by replacing old limiting beliefs with new empowering ones. Let’s say you want to be healthier. You’re eating better and exercising more, but every time you look at yourself in the mirror, you don’t like what you see.   This negative belief can manifest itself as an unpleasant emotion like frustration or anger—or it might even cause physical symptoms like tension headaches or fatigue. The first step is recognizing that this negative seed has taken root in your subconscious mind.   Next comes uprooting those poisonous weeds by replacing them with positive beliefs about yourself: “I’m starting to feel stronger every day!” “My friends think I look great!” “I feel so empowered when I walk upstairs!”     ",

While the author didn’t suddenly let go of all her negative feelings, she felt at ease knowing that she can fully experience her inner world.   At times, it’s best to acknowledge what we truly feel and deal with that before we can enjoy life to its fullest. For this reason, she used the trip to deepen her connection with God, and acknowledge and feel her emotions, so by the time she went back home, her heart was at peace and she could experience fun again.  Another great aspect that the book highlights is the importance of having hobbies. In time, we often forget about our silly passions and leisure activities due to work and overbooked schedules. However, if we truly want to live happier days or deal with whatever is hurting us, hobbies can play a role in the process. ",

You'll learn how millionaires live on less than they make, avoid debt, invest, are disciplined and responsible!  This book is based on the largest study EVER conducted on 10,000 U.S. millionaires--and the results will shock you! You'll learn that building wealth has almost NOTHING to do with your income or your background! It doesn't matter where you come from. It matters where you're going.  Most people think it takes crazy investing knowledge, a giant salary, a streak of luck, or a huge inheritance to become a millionaire. But that couldn't be further from the truth! Here's what you need to understand: if you're willing to do the work--if you'll follow the stuff we teach, if you'll commit to our plan--then you CAN become a millionaire.",

        "Book-summary ": "Lesson 1: The interview carried out by the author shows that most millionaires don’t inherit the money – they work for it. The truth is that most millionaires are self-made men and women who have worked hard to get where they are today. They didn’t inherit their wealth—they created it through hard work and determination, along with some smart investments.   The author states that the interviews he conducted with the millionaires revealed that most of them didn’t inherit the money, but rather worked hard for it. Most of these people didn’t come from good families, high-paying jobs, or famous backgrounds.  Instead, they lived below their means, paid debt quickly, invested early, and kept being consistent in their actions. Michael Phelps is a great example. He is the most successful olympian in history and a phenomenal swimmer. He trained six days a week for six hours, and people still attribute his success to luck.  In fact, most people like to talk about millionaires as if they’re some sort of mystical, incredibly lucky beings. People usually prefer to think of such successful individuals as fortunate rather than hard-working because that comforts them. It means that they can justify their lack of consistency because luck is not purposefully attainable.                       Lesson 2: The myth about millionaires going only to high-end schools, having all sorts of degrees, and working high-paying jobs needs to stop. Millionaires don’t necessarily come from high-end schools, have a bunch of degrees, work in real estate, finance or other such jobs. The truth is that the majority of millionaires do not come from families with money. In fact, some of them did not even graduate from college!  It’s time to rethink the whole idea of “wealthy.” Wealthy is not about how much money you make; it’s about how much money you keep.  Here are some more interesting facts about millionaires:  Millionaires work hard and save their money. They don’t spend it like the majority of people. They make smart investments and follow a budget. Millionaires know how to live below their means—even if they make six figures or more per year! They know that there’s more to life than buying things with credit cards or taking lavish vacations every year.  They invest in their future by saving as much as possible while they’re young so they can retire early and enjoy life later on down the road. Millionaires don’t just have one job—they have multiple sources of income. The secret to becoming wealthy doesn’t always consist of luck, a better job, or more of anything at all. It all narrows down to mastering these money laws and making the best of your income. For this reason, many of these millionaires are regular people who worked basic jobs. What made them wealthy was their habits.                         Lesson 3: Not a single self-made millionaire lives by a victim mentality. You might’ve heard this before, but millionaires, especially the self-made ones, don’t like to complain, don’t gossip much, and they surely don’t blame their misfortune on external factors. In other words, they don’t live by the victim mentality, nor spend too much time overthinking situations.  Instead, they’re men and women of action. Less talk, more doing. Less complaining, more gratitude. The list can go on, but that’s not the point of this lesson. Instead, the aim is to make you understand that a winning mentality and a victim mentality cannot coexist.   To break out of this mindset, you’ll have to practice intentionality. When you’re intentional in your actions, you’re no longer sliding through life, waiting for things to happen as if you were on autopilot. Instead, you make them happen. How? By taking action and mastering your decision-making progress.   Much like everyone else, you too have to make decisions, so you better think them through and be confident in your choices. One way to start deciding when it comes to money instead of hoping the odds play in your favor is through initiating a savings plan, a retirement plan, and an investment plan.  Don’t just wait to get rich. Act upon it! In the same way you complain about the lack of money, you can start putting aside some of those hard-earned pennies. Even better, make them work for you! Set goals and break them into objectives, so that you have a clear plan. In other words, start deciding and ditch the victim mindset.",

Thomas Wolfe wrote standing up in the kitchen, the top of the refrigerator as his desk, dreamily fondling his “male configurations”. . . Jean-Paul Sartre chewed on Corydrane tablets (a mix of amphetamine and aspirin), ingesting ten times the recommended dose each day . . .

        "Book-summary ": "Lesson 1: Inspiration can come from anything, from daily rituals, a warm drink, or a sunset. There are certain things that artists, thinkers, or overall successful people in their field have in common. While they don’t do these things similarly, they do repeat certain actions that help them become more productive.   One of them is working at a certain time during the day. Some artists prefer working at night, while others rely on the daytime to do things. Find your best time and try to focus on work as much as possible during those hours. The other way people become productive is by consuming certain drinks, like coffee.  Beethoven and Mozart were both known for drinking large amounts of coffee to become productive. While the book recommends staying away from too much of everything, and completely avoiding dangerous substances, it’s alright if you indulge in cups of tea or coffee to get in the mood for work.  These accomplished people usually enjoyed such treats in their favorite spot right before work, which is also psychologically proven to boost efficiency. Our brain associates these actions with a prework sort of workout that gets us in the mood.  Lastly, writers and researchers often look for inspiration within their surroundings. They try to draw inspiration from a sunrise, plants, animals, or other elements from natural words. People that are close to you can also help you get into the mood for work. So make sure to surround yourself with these types of humans.                     Lesson 2: There are numerous ways to get inspired and stay connected to your craft. The book talks about different authors and their ways of staying close to their craft, becoming inspired, and writing effectively. Some found peace and motivation in nature, so they’d take long walks until inspiration struck them. Then they’d rush home to create and design their pieces.  Others found that sexual intercourse or pleasure derived from bodily functions gives them enough inspiration to write for days. Baths or long showers also seemed to be popular choices for some authors. The point is, that everyone has different ways of becoming connected to themselves and becoming inspired.  As a writer, it can be challenging to start creating out of thin air and seeing a blank page can be that much more demoralizing. For this reason, you have to find what can help you get in the mood for work and practice that when you feel like you’re lacking motivation.  Lastly, keep in mind that there’s no wrong or right in the creative process. Everyone gets inspired or works on their craft in their particular way. What worked for these people might not prove to be efficient for you, but that’s alright. The point is to find your muse! Whether it means working during the day or night, drinking coffee, taking a shower, or anything at all.                     Lesson 3: Your connections to the people in your life can make or break your creative mind. Any social science in the world can agree on one common fact: Our relationships define us and they also affect our mood. They are the pylon of our social life and they strongly impact our mental health. Friends, partners, parents, and other family members, all have a great impact on our work.  Keeping relationships in good parameters and also nurturing our ties with those we love keeps us in great mental and physical shape. The main point is to draw inspiration from these good ties and keep our souls at peace.   Authors have long relied on their partners for their well-being, treating them as a muse in the process of creation. It doesn’t come as a shock to find out that this is largely how many famous pieces of writing emerged.   Partners or friends can also help us with everyday chores and alleviate some of the pressure from mundane tasks. This way, you can append more time creating and designing your craft. You can see this type of relationship in the lives of Karl Marx, Immanuel Kant, Gustav Mahler, and many more.",

        "Book-summary ": "Lesson 1: Hard, consistent work is what outpaces motivation in the long run. Athletes are some of the most committed people in the world. They train tirelessly, push their bodies to the absolute limit, and don’t allow anything or anyone to stand in their way. But how do they do it? What makes them so different from us? And how can we start to apply their principles to our own lives?  The book states that passion is the essential ingredient for being committed to your work, mastering a job, and coming out ahead—even when the odds aren’t exactly in your favour. Passion gives you the energy to keep pushing when things aren’t all pink and fun anymore.  However, there’s another major component of your success recipe along with talent or passion. Consistency in your hard work is what will get you to the top and help you get past troubled times. Being consistent is more of a mind game than anything else because it requires willpower to sustain.   Motivation is what will get you out of the bed, but consistency and habit will get you through the entire day – and in the long run, that’s what builds a career. For top athletes, consistent training, mental strength, and resilience – are all key ingredients to the secret sauce, and they’re not easy to get across.                          Lesson 2: To get past mistakes, athletes focus on what they can control and practice breathwork. In the world of athletics, mistakes happen. A lot. And when they do, athletes have to be able to move on quickly, or else they’ll never get anywhere. To do this, they use a mindset that’s rooted in stoicism: they focus only on what they can control, and try to let go of what they can’t.   The author, which is a professional coach, tells his athletes to never spend more than five minutes on upsetting mistakes; instead, he advises them to practice breathwork to calm themselves down and keep their focus on the game. People often get so focused on their performance that they get overwhelmed by mistakes.   But there are ways to stay calm, and even thrive off of mistakes! When you’re playing a sport, it’s easy to get caught up in the outcome of each game. You want to win and you want to do well. But when you’re playing, there are things that are out of your control.  Things like the weather, how well your teammates play, and what other teams around the league are doing, they’re all in the background of their minds stealing their focus. So how do athletes stay focused on what they can control? It’s simple – they narrow down what’s in their power to change and what isn’t.   They practice breathwork too—breathing exercises like deep breathing and meditation help calm down their bodies and keep their focus on what matters most: performing at their best. Counting breaths while keeping a clear mind is what helps them regain focus.                         Lesson 3: Excellence means being confident, seeing the good in everything, performing well, and knowing your worth. Athletes are well known for their physical strength, but they also possess mental toughness. Mental toughness is a set of behaviours and practices that help athletes achieve excellence by being confident and toughening their minds to help them, not play against them.  To achieve this mental toughness, they must be positive or at least try their best to keep things optimistic. When you’re a positive person, good things will happen to you, and that’s not just karmic knowledge coming into play. Psychology supports these facts of life through a concept called frequency illusion.   For example, when you decide that you like a certain car, you’re going to see it everywhere you go. It’s the same with positivity. Now, another important trait of winners is that they’re humble, but also confident.   One great thing about this book is that it highlights how a person with a healthy mindset can be both of these things – in fact, they should be! Being humble means being open to criticism, feedback, and acknowledging when someone else simply did it better than you.  Confidence comes with training and consistency. Being confident means knowing where you stand without being arrogant about it. It means knowing that you did your best and that your value stays the same regardless of the outcome of a competition. Naturally, these three traits go hand-in-hand in sports and in life. ",

        "Author-name ": "Cal Newport",
        "Book-description ": "From New York Times bestselling author Cal Newport comes a bold vision for liberating workers from the tyranny of the inbox--and unleashing a new era of productivity.  Modern knowledge workers communicate constantly. Their days are defined by a relentless barrage of incoming messages and back-and-forth digital conversations--a state of constant, anxious chatter in which nobody can disconnect, and so nobody has the cognitive bandwidth to perform substantive work. There was a time when tools like email felt cutting edge, but a thorough review of current evidence reveals that the hyperactive hive mind workflow they helped create has become a productivity disaster, reducing profitability and perhaps even slowing overall economic growth. Equally worrisome, it makes us miserable. Humans are simply not wired for constant digital communication.  We have become so used to an inbox-driven workday that it's hard to imagine alternatives. But they do exist. Drawing on years of investigative reporting, author and computer science professor Cal Newport makes the case that our current approach to work is broken, then lays out a series of principles and concrete instructions for fixing it. In A World without Email, he argues for a workplace in which clear processes--not haphazard messaging--define how tasks are identified, assigned and reviewed. Each person works on fewer things (but does them better), and aggressive investment in support reduces the ever-increasing burden of administrative tasks. Above all else, important communication is streamlined, and inboxes and chat channels are no longer central to how work unfolds.",
        "Book-img-url": "https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1597016311l/54326146.jpg",
        "Book-summary ": "Lesson 1: Instant messaging and emailing can decrease productivity drastically in the workplace. Everyone uses emails at work – it’s just the way things are right now. Emails keep us connected and enhance collaboration within teams. Sounds good? That’s what the companies thought. However, it seems that communication through inboxes might do more harm than good.   On average, a worker checks their email every six minutes. One-third of our working day is spent navigating inboxes, and the average knowledge worker does an hour and 15 minutes of productive work a day, according to a study conducted by RescueTime.  The main reason behind these demotivating numbers is that emails and notifications became like an addiction to us. And organizational cultures are pushing them to keep the collaborative flow going and increase responsiveness. The intention behind this concept is good, but in practice, it kills productivity.   That is because we are wired to only focus on one thing at a time. And keeping many tabs open and working with information in the back of our mind just doesn’t sit well with the prefrontal cortex. The result? Decreased attention, a lack of focus, and increased stress levels.                     Lesson 2: To improve productivity, we have to switch to project management execution apps instead of emails. Emails are outdated project assignation tools, and for a reason. They decrease the attention span by keeping employees hooked to a constantly open tab. Not only that, but they also get messy and unstructured.  Instead, business thinkers like Peter Drucker have better ideas when it comes to improving the workflow. Drucker acknowledged two types of work: the knowledge workers and the factory-type workers.   Factory-type workers are most efficient when they divide their work into smaller chunks and are responsible for their own small area of activity. With knowledge workers, things get a bit more complicated, because you can’t tell them how to be creative, but you can’t monitor them and inhibit their creative thinking.   However, what you can do is interfere with the way they do things or their framework. Apps like Trello or Flow are specialized in assigning tasks and they limit the use of email to a great extent. This is great news because as we all know, emails do inhibit productivity.   Make sure to include employees in the workflow change and give them autonomy in their decisions. Always double-check with them to see if they like and agree with the changes and what tasks they’d like to receive.                            Lesson 3: People work best when they receive straightforward, coordinated tasks. Emails are a great means of communication, but what happens when we don’t know what to communicate? Most of the time, they get in the way of productivity. The problem with emails is that people feel productive writing and reading them when they’re in fact not productive at all.  Many times over management agents noticed how people pass around tasks and explanations because no one really knows how to deal with them. Responsibilities are often misassigned, unaligned with deadlines or objectives, or ambiguous for the receiving end.   For this reason, team members assign them between each other and spend precious working hours moving tasks around, without actually following up on them or getting things done. This phenomenon boils down to one solution: assigning employees straightforward, structured, organized tasks.   Every employee should receive work that they perceive easy to understand, follow up on, and get done. A deadline is an effective way to set standards of operation, while an “open door policy” is always a great idea to encourage communication. The best way to set these aspects in place is through management apps that deliver. ",

        "Book-summary ": "Lesson 1: To become productive, you’ll have to start organizing your time according to the four quadrants. Struggling with procrastination is a real thing, and it all boils down to one main issue – we don’t know how to manage our time. What’s worse is that we think we’re good at doing so. That is why we also reject scientific methods and advice on the matter, thinking that we know better.   Let’s debunk this once and for all – you’re never going to move past your recurring procrastination without a system. A time management system can help you organize your tasks more efficiently and finally get things done. Let’s start with the four quadrants so you get a better idea of what I’m talking about.  The four quadrants of your time are:  Q1 – which includes your important and urgent work. (E.g. emergencies) Q2  – which includes important, but non-urgent tasks (E.g. work, preparing for meetings, etc.) – this is where you want to spend most of your time  Q3 – which includes urgent but non-important work (E.g. checking emails) Q4 – which includes time spent on meaningless things (E.g. checking social media)  Carry out a self-analysis and think about where you spend most of your time. Your work day should imply a lot of Q2 time, less Q1 and Q3 time, and minimal Q4 time. Structure your work in these four quadrants. Every time you feel like doing something, ask yourself where your task fits in. That way, you’ll know how much time you should spend on it.                        Lesson 2: Define your role titles, your role statements, and your schedule to set better goals. By now you know that you should be spending most of your work time in Q2 doing important but non-urgent work. But what is that? Our jobs are complex and they require many tasks, so what’s important may seem blurry at times. Well, this is why you should define your role titles and statements.  Your role title is the main category of work you’ll be doing, while your role statement defines where you want to be. Let’s focus on an example: your role title can be “professional wedding planner’’, while your role statement may look like “I want to become the best wedding planner in town.”  This set of statements can help you start organizing your goals and your schedule. Now that you’ve defined them, you can start setting goals and objectives to achieve them step by step. Make sure to time-bound your goals so that you have a deadline to focus on. Then, it’s time to set your schedule.  Given a deadline, you now have to estimate how much time you can dedicate each day to meet that end goal. Let’s say you want to become the best wedding planner in town in one year. How much time will that take each month? What about every day? If it’s two hours a day, add that to your Q2 time daily to meet your criteria.                          Lesson 3: To reap all the benefits of a time management system, you’ll have to nurture your body and energy levels. Now that you’ve learned about the time management system presented in this book and got an idea of the strategies you need to use to implement it, it’s time to focus on the most important aspect of this system – you.   Without a body and a mind to hold everything together, even the most efficient time management book is useless. You need to sustain your energy levels and take care of your physic if you want to be consistent in this approach. If not, you’ll likely come across burnout, vitamin deficiencies, mental breakdowns, and whatnot.  Nowadays, our lives can get pretty busy and stressful. So making sure we’re keeping up with them is crucial for success. You can do so by nourishing your three sources of energy:  The powerful purpose (or the motivation/ satisfaction you get from work) The physical body (your overall health levels) The connections (your network and social life, your relationships with friends and family) Without these three sources of energy ticked, it’ll be impossible for you to become productive. For this reason, make sure to engage in purposeful work or even enroll in a charity program, to carry out a healthy lifestyle, and actively communicate with your close circle.",

        "Book-summary ": "Lesson 1: There are three core rules of advertising that you can use to market a successful brand. There are a lot of misconceptions associated with advertising. Marketers worldwide often promote products to the wrong market, at the wrong time, in all the wrong way. Fortunately, there is indeed a success formula – sort of – to use if you want to maximize your efforts.   The first rule of branding is the Law of Expansion. This law states that companies become weaker as they try to advertise a broad range of products or services. Take street shops and deli businesses that sell an incredible array of items. Do you have a brand in mind? Not really.   The first company to narrow its deli business was Subway, and it did the right move as it became an internationally recognized brand. The second law of branding is the Law of Contraction, which is practically the opposite of the first law. The more you narrow your offering, the easier it becomes to advertise.  This is how brands form and become recognizable. Similar to the first two laws, we’ve got the Law of Singularity, which preaches the importance of focusing efforts on creating a brand that’s synonym to an everyday object or idea. Prego is the spaghetti sauce, Rolex is the highly luxurious watch, and Walmart is the go-to place for cheap products.                      Lesson 2: The Law of Publicity and the Law of Advertising can help you build a brand that sells. The fourth law of marketing and branding is the Law of Publicity, which is key when it comes to building a brand from scratch. Publicity is essential to any brand looking to scale, regardless of its size. Without it, your business isn’t going to be successful. A great start is by being the first within an industry.  However, in such a competitive market, that can get tough. Still, you can make your product stand out by delivering extra features, implementing unique selling points, and just by being original overall. However, when it comes to advertising your already existing brand, the Law of Advertising comes in.  This law states that your purpose as a business is to defend your gain in the market after launch. You don’t do so by overly advertising your superiority over your competitors, or by spamming users with ads – all those strategies fail in the long run.   Users want to know that your product is the top choice within its category – and that’s what you should advertise. Focus on your offerings and why your product can change your customer’s life for the better, and not on what your competitor is doing. Make yourself stand out and hold on tight to the ground you’ve got.                    Lesson 3: The last four laws of branding will get your product from average to exceptional. The sixth law of branding is the Law of the Word, which states that you should associate your brand with a powerful word. Mercedes is highly associated with “prestige”, while Honda is thought to be “well-engineered”. What’s your catchword?   What’s even better is to make the world associate your product with a concept itself. Think of companies like Xerox or Pampers who became worldwide used words. Now, on to the next law, which is the Law of Category. This one presents the idea of advertising an entire category of products once you’ve achieved leadership.  It will probably help your competition too, which is why it may sound counter-intuitive to do so. However, the more attention there is in the field, the more likely it is to have people buy even more from you. The eighth law is the Law of Credentials. This once states that you should build authority through factual claims.   You only need a great first impression and a one-time proven claim. Then, you’ll be able to make secondary assumptions based on your trust. This concept goes hand in hand with the tenth Law of Quality. This one is about the importance of the perception of quality. If you advertise your product as a top-quality one well-enough, people will buy it.",

        "Book-summary ": "Lesson 1: Medical advancements and in-depth research about lifestyle choices shaped a world of increased longevity. If you take a look back in history, the world was much different than we know it today. Without accounting for worse economic conditions or wars, medicine and technological advancements were nowhere near the standards we know today.   On top of that, people had poorer perceptions regarding nutrition, medical conditions, old age, and other similar aspects of life. Smoking was a social norm, sugar was on every table, and nutrition was about losing weight.   Essentially, nothing was as we know it today, and that is reflected in the average lifespan. Nowadays, every decade brings breakthrough discoveries in all industries, and with them, added years to our lives.   Infants are no longer dying. Diseases like cancer, Alzheimers, smallpox or any other illness are no longer killing as many people as they used to. And people are overall more health-conscious. Great news, right?   Well, yes and no. As we advance in these fields and medicine breaks through new layers of knowledge, our life span increases substantially.  This fact poses a new issue for humans: what are we going to do once we’re approaching the triple-digit age? Will our resources suffice? How will our social lives look? Or tour professional careers – will they still come to an end as we’re moving past the age of 60? Guess we’ll live and see!                     Lesson 2: People should prepare for old age by learning new skills in demand. We’ve all seen at least one futuristic, sci-fi movie where the characters end up in a future ruled by AI-driven robots, flying cars, machine humans, and dynamic buildings. While we can’t promise the flying cars part, we surely do notice the increasingly growing role AI plays in our everyday lives already.   AI-driven machines are taking over automatized intellectual and physical processes while delivering error-free results. Soon, most probably in our lifetime, people will have to adapt to these changes and learn skills that are in demand, which implies working alongside robots.   Creative work and jobs that probably haven’t even been discovered yet will take over the current professional environments. Therefore, in order to secure an income, we’ll have to switch the focus to computer skills, innovative and lateral thinking, social skills, and other similar fields.   Other areas of improvement that will prove worthwhile in our life include self-awareness and health. Focusing on nutrition and fitness will be invaluable in the long run. Focusing on mental health and the ability to learn fast helps too. While right now it may not seem like a big thing, try thinking ahead. How would your 80-something-year-old like to live? Healthy and active, or passive and bored?                      Lesson 3: Building financial strength comes from trying, failing, and exploring. The world has changed for the better. And that means that you have the flexibility to live a life like no one before you. No one expects us to go to college, find a job at 20-something-years-old, stay with the company till we retire, and then die. Frankly, a life spent working for big corporations doesn’t sound appealing to the masses anymore.  Instead, newer generations are aiming for independence, remote work, years off to explore new cultures and countries, and freelance gigs. This is good news, as it allows people to explore themselves more, learn about life in depth and get to know the world while they’re also learning about themselves.   As we have more time to live and there’s less pressure to join a career movement, people find that life is much more about exploring than earning. In fact, it’s recommended to take some time to do so in your twenties, in your mid-forties, and again in your seventies. These stages of life are usually marked by big changes.  Financial independence also comes from these stages of exploration, and more importantly, from a continuous trial-and-error process. When learning these new skills in demand, it’s important to try them out and see how you can monetize them. This can take years to get done, but it’s all for the better – for a safe old age.",

        "Book-summary ": "Lesson 1: Everything we are comes from our thoughts. Your inner dialogue is private—no one else can hear it except you! So if you’re ever worried about what someone else might think of how you speak to yourself, remember that they don’t know! Just like most people don’t know what kind of inner dialogues other people are having with themselves all day long either!  So, if you want a better life then start talking more positively to yourself today! Why? Well, let’s see. The book states that thoughts turn into electrical impulses, which in turn become actions. We all have thoughts, and those become actions pretty quickly.   From how you look at the world to how you act towards others, your thoughts determine your life. When you talk to yourself, you are programming your mind with the ideas that will shape the future. The more you think about something, the more likely it is that you will act on it in the future.   When you talk to yourself about what needs to be done, what needs to be fixed or improved, what needs to be changed or avoided altogether—these are all things that will have a lasting impact on your life and the lives of those around you.                   Lesson 2: Everything we want is achievable through mind reprogramming. When you want to achieve your goals, it’s crucial to think positively and take the initiative in an actionable manner. Thoughts are the driving force behind our actions.   They can be positive or negative, and they can help us move forward or hold us back. If you have a bad habit, you probably know exactly what thought pattern keeps you stuck in that habit.   We all want to change our habits for the better, but if we don’t understand how our thoughts work and how they impact our actions, we’re not going to get very far!   That’s why it’s important to understand how your brain works: More or less, thoughts turn into electrical impulses and then into actions. To leverage the process, start reprogramming your mind to work for you, not against you.   According to the author, the process of reprogramming your mind goes like this:  Programming creates beliefs. Beliefs create attitudes. Attitudes create feelings. Feelings determine actions. Actions create results The single best method of applying the reprogramming framework to your mind is to literally talk yourself into it. Improve your inner talk and notice the differences in your life.                             Lesson 3: Understand self-talk before you attempt to change it. Reprogramming starts with replacing old and negative thoughts with refreshing perspectives that will serve you well in life. To replace such pessimistic thoughts, you must first identify them and then find a better option to fill your mind with.   It all begins with the five levels of self-talk that the author presents:   Negative acceptance – This level is where many of us are trapped in. Some signs that may show you’re stuck here consist of negative talk like “I can’t do this”, “I will never get there”, and other negations.  Recognition and need to change – Here people often use expressions such as “I need to change”, “I should do so”, “I will do something about it”, etc. Decision to change – This is a powerful level to find yourself into. Here you are committed to change and want to improve yourself for good. The better you – This level is where you feel in control of your life and you recognize that you are the agent of change. Here you’re adopting the winner mentality. Universal affirmation – In the last level you are universally committed to live your life meaningfully and purposefully. Here you take actionable change easier, and experience openness with the Universe.  Now, take a moment to reflect on your self-talk. Where are you on this scale? What is it that you could improve when it comes to talking to yourself? Words, even unspoken, have a tremendous effect on your actions. If you want to change your life, start by changing your words.",

        "Book-summary": "Lesson 1: A successful long-term strategy of an institution usually includes endowments Many organizations around the world, whether they’re public institutions, universities or colleges, charities or trusts, or even NGOs, have endowments that ensure their long-term success. An endowment is a donation received by an institution from an individual or another institution, which has to be kept under the receiving organization’s ownership for as long as they function.  Although the receiving organization can benefit from an endowment through interest or other financial benefits that may arise, the endowment can’t be sold, so as to ensure the perpetuating prosperity of the organization.  For example, an alumnus donated 96 acres of land to Yale in 1996, which is considered an endowment. Reaping the benefits, such as interest, helps Yale keep their financial status in great parameters. Although they are crucial for long-term success, some people may not rush when it comes to accepting endowments.  The uncomfortable aspect of receiving them as an institution is that the donor may require the organization to carry out research in different fields upon request, use the funds in a certain way, or take certain decisions that may not appeal to the executives of the enterprise. For this reason, not all donations go through as endowments.               Lesson 2: When investing, you must take into consideration three core aspects A wise investor knows that in order to get on top of the game, they must invest in a smart way. That means considering the risk factor, the time frame, the securities they bet on, and many other crucial aspects. In fact, an investment analysis starts with three core aspects:  Asset allocation Market timing Security selection Asset allocation implies picking the classes of assets that you’ll be investing in. This factor is the most important when it comes to forecasting returns. The second aspect, which is market timing, refers to seizing opportunities in the market based on current events.   In the long strategy of an investor, there are moments to buy, moments to hold, and moments to sell. Market timing is all about that, and it can help investors pick security on discounts or avoid buying overpriced ones. Lastly, there’s the security selection.   Here an investor decides if they’re going to be active or passive in their approach. A passive investor mimics the market and does not actively pick or trade their securities in the short-term or long-term strategy, because the market returns a higher average than most investors can on their own. Therefore a passive strategy is more successful in highly efficient markets (bonds, stocks).   In contrast, active investors do their own research and pick their securities according to certain parameters. They do this in the hope to gain a higher than average return on investments. However, the active approach is advised for real estate markets, private equity, venture capital, or any investment that must usually be picked individually.                           Lesson 3: Diversifying your portfolio is one of the most powerful principles of investing Way too often, investors jump in too early or too late in the market. Or they invest only in highly-traded, increasingly popular securities because their peers do too. Unfortunately, this approach to investing has left many people and institutions with their empty pockets hanging.   Instead, the key to success is a long-term vision and a diversified portfolio. As mentioned before one of the core aspects of investing is asset allocation. Among the different types of securities, an investor or an institution must choose different asset classes and allocate funds accordingly.   A well-balanced portfolio usually includes stocks, bonds, and real estate, all from domestic, foreign, and private markets. Due to the fact that markets fluctuate and drop in value at times, it’s best not to have “all your eggs in one basket”. Allocating funds to various asset classes will ensure that your net worth fluctuates as little as possible while increasing at a steady pace.   A good rule of thumb between investors is not to allocate belfow 5-10% to a single class of assets. Why? Because it won’t affect your overall performance. Don’t allocate above 25-30% either. Doing so can hold too much of your net value blocked in case of a crash.",

        "Book-summary": "Lesson 1: Receiving a “no” can help you get some significant insights into your business idea Let’s say you’ve just finished pitching your idea to a potential investor. And after your presentation, all you get is a no. That’s it, they didn’t even consider another option. Or perhaps they evaluate your idea in detail, and then they say no. Another situation is when they didn’t even hear it right, yet they rushed to greet you with a negative answer. You see, different no’s have different meanings.  However, all of them can help you re-evaluate your business and come up with better ideas. In any case, receiving a no should never keep you from chasing your goal, but it should help you reassess it, perhaps. Oftentimes you hear criticism from your family and friends, who don’t want to see you hurt.   Ask them why they don’t like your idea, and if they can’t be specific about it, it’s an emotional-based opinion. If your investors refuse your idea straight away, they could be trying to spare themselves an uninteresting pitch. Therefore, take that opportunity to reevaluate your business and address the weaknesses. Do so when you receive a detailed no as well, and ask for advice.  Sometimes a no can give you the chance to grow your idea even stronger before you take it to the market. Chances are you won’t succeed at first. But after a while and if you persevere, your idea will grow stronger than ever. The lesson here is to learn to differentiate between a lazy and a real no and learn from them later.                                        Lesson 2: Your customers have the most valuable insights into your business Scaling up can prove to be a real challenge if you don’t know how to set the pace for this process. Luckily, all the information you need to take this leap forward is already in the market. So the only thing you have to do is look for it. Scaling up your business through referrals or huge promos can speed up the process. But it’s important to know if you can handle that.  Always expect the unexpected. What if so much more people than you’ve imagined sign up for your list of products? On the other hand, fearing the market is another impediment for entrepreneurs. There isn’t such a thing as the perfect momenfcret. However, you can get pretty close if you listen to your customer’s needs and wants.  Then, serving them your solution at the right time and not waiting forever to perfect your craft can prove to save your company from starvation. A great way to tell what your customers are thinking is by listening to what they’re doing, rather than what they’re saying.  Oftentimes, customers say they love an outfit from Fashion Week. And yet, they seem reluctant to buy it because they can’t wear it in their everyday life. Therefore, companies that come up with more casual outfits for everyday wear, although they prompt themselves through the famous event, are more successful than ever!                             Lesson 3: Successful companies have great leaders and are extremely flexible The journey of an entrepreneur is volatile, dynamic, and risky. That’s simply the nature of the business itself, and a good leader knows it. Excellent leader knows that they should always be prepared for the unexpected and that even their core business dynamic can change in a day.  Take Airbnb for example. During the pandemic, the company couldn’t accommodate people like before, so they switched to promoting remote working places for people who went online, virtual tours, local attractions, and even virtual salsa lessons!  Airbnb was never in this type of business, but they had to adapt to the new environment, and so they did! A great leader knows that an obstacle calls for another way to get around the problem, and come up with an even better solution instead. Improvising and adapting are two of the key traits of any successful executive.  Lastly, a great leader knows the importance of the social responsibility of an organization. Before Starbucks was profitable, it offered the first comprehensive health insurance program to all its employees. Other companies choose to be environmental-friendly, help local communities, and so on.",

        "Book-summary": "Lesson 1: Munger’s successful career had many drawbacks throughout its course Charlie Munger wasn’t always the successful investor he is today. In fact, he doesn’t even hold a bachelor’s degree. During his teenage years, he always had a passion for studying and reading as much as he could. As such, he spent most of his days in libraries and lived through the books he was reading. After his studies at the University of Michigan were interrupted, he managed to learn a series of informal skills that proved to be quite useful during his lifetime.  Among the subjects, he’s studied were medicine and science, then mathematics and physics. WWII sent him to study different fields, become a pilot, and serve the army. Eventually, he finished Harvard Law with Magna Cum Laude.   His cross-disciplinary skills proved to be of utmost importance when it came to his career in finance, as he was able to use multiple fields of knowledge to get ahead of the game. No matter how many challenges crossed his path, he managed to learn something from each and every one of them.   The lesson here is to keep on learning and pushing through despite life’s hardships. No matter what you read about, make it a habit to absorb more and more information as you go through life. You never know when it’ll prove to be useful for you. Moreover, improve your work ethic. Munger insists on finishing things the first time, instead of going back to repeat the process. A strong determination to do things right and learn every day will get you far in life, just as it happened with him.                                  Lesson 2: The key to Munger and Buffett’s successful business was morality, honesty, and respect Early in his professional life, Munger started a law firm that went on with its operations successfully, yet something didn’t sit right with him. It wasn’t long after when he had to take a trip to Omaha to close on some real estate he inherited, where he met Buffett. Their shared interest in the business world and investing was enough to spark a long-lasting business relationship between them.  As a result, Munger joined Buffett in managing Berkshire Hathaway, one of the most successful investing enterprises of today. Their immense success was built on a strong work ethic, and more importantly, a series of moral principles. Unlike most Wall Street investors, who con people for a living, Berkshire made it a mission to do away with insider trading and doctoring the books to make certain securities look more promising.   For a company with 175,000 employees, the cases of litigations and scandals are very few. The company sees tax evasion and cutting corners as something unaligned with its principles. And the two managers take it quite personally when middlemen do so. Of course, scandals occurred, especially when Munger stated that you have to do business with people who share your ethics, but then the company engaged in lucrative partnerships with Solomon Brothers, a corrupt bank.  Still, such scandals are considered sealed today, as Munger and Buffett proved their worth. As such, it’s of great importance to first build a strong work ethic, do things the right way on a first try, engage only in moral businesses and work with companies who value integrity. This formula guarantees success without you giving up on your peace of mind.                                           Lesson 3: Munger appreciates people who own up to their mistakes because it’s only natural to make errors in life Throughout his life, Munger made some terrible mistakes when it comes to business. He failed to buy more stock in valuable companies, he thought Walmart was a costly stock before it skyrocketed, and he once failed to acknowledge that See’s Candy is a great investment prospect.   Luckily, other agents made him change his mind about that one. Still, he acknowledges that to err is human and that owning up to your mistakes is the most important thing after all. One time a middleman made a terrible mistake that ended up costing the company hundreds of thousands of dollars. In this instance, the man confessed immediately and was willing to suffer all the consequences. Fortunately, this was the exact reason why Munger forgave him and allowed him to keep his job.  Another important trait to develop is the ability to change your mind.  We can’t possibly be right all the time, and sometimes huge opportunities can pass us by if we don’t accept second opinions or new perspectives. If Charlie Munger could rethink his position in See’s Candy, you too can take a second look at your most important decisions in life. Keep in mind that there’s always room for improvement and other people’s contributions can help you.",

        "Book-summary": "Lesson 1: Compounding interest can be applied to your finances and your relationships So what is compound interest? Essentially, it’s when your money makes more money, and then that money makes even more money. Take the following example: you invest 10,000 dollars into the stock market for an interest of 10% annually. Then, you cash them out and reinvest 11,000 dollars back. Naturally, those 11,000 will be worth 12,100 dollars next year.   Albert Einstein once said that compound interest is the eighth world wonder. As such, this concept is definitely worth implementing in your life, and not just from a financial point of view. Sure, investing in the stock and bond market is a one way ticket to success, as long as you manage the risk with extreme care and reinvest the gains to grow exponentially. However, compounding can be used in your relationships as well.  Successful people worldwide are viewed as reliable and trustworthy. When they are recommended by their peers, their network grows. Once they prove what they’re worth, their value grows in the network. In other words, they use the compound rule to build their reputation and integrity.                           Lesson 2: Money is the ultimate tool for freedom Don’t be the person who says that money is the root of all evil, that you don’t need them to be happy, or that you’re not interested in building wealth. Sure, these affirmations are true, up to a certain point. However, many use them to justify not growing their mindset and accepting the status-quo in their life. Truth be told, money is a great thing to have, especially if you know how to use it.  To change this mentality, you must first accept that money is something you can have and that they can give you freedom. Essentially, this is what you’ll use them for, to buy time. It is the tool you need to experience the real values of life. As such, the meaning you give to it can alter the course of your life. If your end goal is to simply build more and more wealth, money will get you nowhere.  However, if you want to acquire freedom, the chance to spend more time with your family, help those in need, dance more, or whatever it is that your spiritual self craves, you’re on the right path. For that, you’ll need to learn how to play the money game right. Fearing that you’ll lose what you’ve earned and being unhappy with what you have is an unhealthy approach. Moreover, the end goal isn’t more money, so keep that in mind.  Instead, actively engage in conversations, listen to educational videos, and look up ways to build wealth while living a meaningful life. Don’t lose sight of the present, yet keep an eye on the future. More importantly, don’t inflate your lifestyle as you earn more money. Save and invest them to build a future out of the rat race, instead of upgrading your treadmill.                                 Lesson 3: To become happy, learn how to be neutral and stay quiet Contrary to popular belief, in order to be happy, we don’t need much. Just look at children playing. They don’t stress much about the future, nor the past, but rather explore the present moment and immerse themselves into whatever they’re doing at that time. Pausing our human ability to judge, we’ll find new ways of becoming happier.  Why? Just think of a tree. A tree doesn’t know right or wrong, it just feels the wind, the sun, and whatever else is going on in nature. A tree is neutral, and so you should be. Judging the present moment, whether it feels right or wrong, is only making our subconscious compare it to other moments in our life or someone else’s. Rather than doing so, it’s best to just let it be. Acknowledge each moment, but don’t judge it. Make neutrality work in your favor.  Another way to become happier is to quiet down your mind. Your subconscious and mind chatter make it quite difficult for you to find a moment for yourself, even while alone. That is why many of us fear loneliness, preferring the wrong company over no company. Still, sitting alone as monks do can be a blissful moment, so in order to find peace and happiness, you ought to try that and also meditate for a little while. Face your thoughts and let go of them in a peaceful way.",

        "Book-summary": "Lesson 1: Stocks may not be as risky as they seem if you give the market sufficient time to prove their worth In finance and economics, there is a universal conception that bonds are safer investments than stocks. If you look at them from a volatility ratio perspective, stocks will definitely fluctuate more than bonds, with no promise to deliver returns. In contrast to that, they can even wipe out your life savings if you’re not careful.   However, there are many factors to consider when investing in stocks over bonds. To start with, they’ve proven to be better investments over prolonged time frames, delivering higher returns than bonds, after inflation. Given a period of twenty years, Siegel suggests that any decent company will deliver positive returns for its investors.   Essentially, bonds are less volatile, but they deliver fewer profits over time, while sometimes they can’t even keep up with inflation. That’s because bonds move according to the interest rate, which sometimes doesn’t work in the investor’s favor. Let’s take the 1946-2001 time frame. During this period, stocks have produced an average return of 6,8% and gold had a -0,1% return. Meanwhile, bonds had an annual real return of -2,8%. Moreover, the data doesn’t include the average dividend rate of 4,6% annually.   Although it seems that stocks have more ups and downs, they are definitely less risky. That’s because the other securities can’t always keep up with the inflation rate. Let alone deliver a positive return for investors. Isn’t placing a possible winning trade less risky than placing an undeniably losing one?                                Lesson 2: Stocks are not always priced according to their underlying value The market is an efficient mechanism for placing trades   and finding stocks of all sorts. However, when it comes to the price of stocks, it may not always show the true value of a security. Investors have a tendency to switch from over-optimism to exaggerated pessimism, thus the volatility of this industry.   As such, an instrument has an intrinsic value, given by the value of the company (revenue, management effectiveness, profit margin, cash flow, and many other aspects) and the value of its stock price, which doesn’t necessarily reflect the first. A company listed on the stock exchange is rarely properly valued, and it is the investor’s job to determine whether a stock is worth buying or currently undervalued.  Stocks fluctuate for numerous reasons. Siegel suggests that the “noisy market hypothesis” is a good potential explanation for this. It states that stocks are being pushed away from their real prices by investors trading for unrelated purposes. These include tax harvesting, rebalancing portfolios, cutting losses, taking profits, and so on. One is better off keeping their money invested in the long run instead of panic selling in times of loss.                             Lesson 3: Keep your money invested in ETFs and find value stocks ETF stands for Exchange Traded Fund. It is a security that tracks an index, a commodity like gold or silver, or an industry. It also tracks other types of assets. This security trades like a stock and is publicly bought and sold on a stock exchange just like other regular shares.   The main advantage of such a security is its ability to withstand a market pullback, while also delivering remarkable returns for investors. For example, by investing in an ETF tracking an index made of companies, such as the famous S&P 500, you don’t just buy the shares of one company, but a small fraction of all 500 companies from the index. You can buy and sell an ETF during the market hours just like you buy a stock, and expect it to replicate the index perfectly, without you worrying about a thing.  Another type of investment the author praises is the value stock. Unlike a growth stock, which many expect to beat the market and grow exponentially, deliver remarkable returns, and usually overvalued so it presents a great risk, a value stock has other attributes. It is a stock of companies that have not yet been discovered, have strong and promising figures, stable management effectiveness and growth over the years, and most importantly, trade under their fair price.  Finding a value stock can be challenging. Especially so with all the funds and retail investors keeping an eye on the markets 24/7. You may think that there is no way to discover a value stock before it becomes mainstream. But if you look around for your favorite shop, service providers, promising businesses, or simply find companies that are publicly traded and look up their numbers, you’d be surprised of how much valuable information you can find.",

        "Book-summary ": "Lesson 1: Investing in crypto is very risky, so prepare emotionally and financially for that Volatility is probably one of the first things to consider when investing in cryptocurrencies. Their price fluctuates drastically even during days, nevertheless months or years. As such, you have to filter the emotional factor of investing out and focus on the long term. Not only is it good for your health, but your wallet too. In time, powerful and reputable projects will show their worth.  A coin’s value is determined by the market sentiment. If people sell more than they buy, the price will drop, and vice versa. However, the market is not always rational, so it will often overlook the bigger picture and react strongly to news, events, and more recently, tweets. However, the intelligent market participant knows that if their coin’s prospect hasn’t changed, there’s no need to panic sell.  This leads us to the next idea ― always put your money into valuable assets, such as coins that have a good management team behind them, a utility factor that proves how they bring a solution to a relevant problem and have a finite supply. Essentially, you don’t want to risk your hard-earned savings to invest in a non-valuable cryptocurrency, as you’ll potentially see significant drops in its price in the blink of an eye.  Therefore, it’s wise to invest only the amount of money that you can afford to lose. Ideally, you should build an emergency fund that could cover between three and six months of expenses, and invest the rest. Assess the value of a coin properly and don’t react to the market sentiment. As long as your token hasn’t changed its fundamental value, all should be fine in the long haul.                          Lesson 2: The blockchain technology and smart contracts solve real problems Blockchain – what is it? This disruptive technology set the foundation for all cryptocurrencies and most importantly, for Bitcoin. Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency and it is still the most popular digital coin on the market. So how did it gain such popularity? Well, people started to acknowledge the cleverness behind Bitcoin as they discovered the blockchain.  This is a decentralized digital system that allows users to trade and store information securely and efficiently. Information is placed in a block and stamped with a date and time. Once the block is filled with data, it is added to the previous block, thus forming the blockchain. This leaves no room for centralized entities to manipulate data and errors to occur, as it is based on a user-centric approach.   You can already see how the blockchain is solving a real-life problem and makes it almost impossible for people to commit fraud or errors. Then, smart contracts come into play. Just like regular contracts, they are an agreement between two parties to commit to a certain action. Smart contracts help users meet their contract’s terms and conditions by automating its execution.                    Lesson 3: Use diversification to your advantage Diversification is the best tool for minimizing losses that you have on your hand. Why is that? Well, as you buy more classes of assets, and even more assets of the same class, the risk of them falling at the same time lowers. Therefore, if one of your investments goes wrong, there’s always another going better to average the loss.   By diversification, the author means buying non-cryptocurrencies as well. The crypto market is highly volatile, so the risk of having your investment’s price drop double digits percents exists. Therefore, to avoid huge financial losses and not miss out on other markets, you should consider stocks or ETFs, bonds, or even real estate. You cannot go wrong with all of them, right?  Even if you are a high-risk high-reward investor, you should always aim to secure your assets first. As such, it’s important to create a safe online wallet as well. Wallets exist to help you store your cryptocurrencies in a safe manner and retrieve them when you need them. Aim for reputable platforms with millions of users and read the reviews before you put your money in a specific wallet app.",

        "Book-summary": "Lesson 1: You must perform a comprehensive analysis on your stock before you invest in it Naturally, you can’t just place your money in a company without conducting comprehensive research on it beforehand. So where do you start? First, make a list of the companies you wish to research. You could also look up potential names from the industries that you understand best.  Then you will have to narrow it down by conducting extensive analysis. Research their activity profile and industry analysis, their competitors, their main clients, and how they manage their money. These are all challenging to research, that is why the scuttlebutt method can prove to be highly efficient.   It implies contacting their stakeholders directly and learning information firsthand. This way, you get to form your own idea about the company in the most accurate way. However, it can be quite time-consuming to do such thorough research. So make sure you pick the right stocks to work with.  Make sure to take into account their management effectiveness and if they’re investing in research and development. This denotes if they’re oriented towards the future when it comes to their product line and services. Moreover, check their reputation when it comes to employee and customer satisfaction to know if they have a strong or weak organization.                  Lesson 2: Always buy low and then sell your stock for a higher price Essentially, investing comes down to buying and selling, right? Of course, the best way to increase your wealth is to buy a stock when the price is low, and then sell it later on when you see an increase. Although this sounds obvious, you’d be surprised to see how your mentality changes when it comes to practice.   When money’s in the game, people often get scared when their stocks fall, and therefore panic sell to avoid further losses. More often than not, the stock will recover and the price will increase significantly. Thus, the average investor will want to hop on this train and catch the upward trend due to the fear of missing out. This process repeats itself again and again.  This often creates overvalued or undervalued stocks in the market. As a long-term investor, you must always look for the future. Learn that the market is irrational and is always acting on short-term events. For example, a well-established company may drive down its profits due to an expense in the R&D department. Although this will benefit the company later, investors don’t see it that way.  If you time your entry properly, you can increase your wealth significantly. Then, keep your position during market dips, as they’re transitory, and focus on the long-term. Warren Buffett, one of the greatest investors of all time, once said: “Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.”                 Lesson 3: Look for mature companies and seek stable, long-term profits To trade or to invest – that’s the dilemma many people face. It may look appealing to cash in short-term profits or sell when you catch your stock going down early. The greatest investors, however, suggest that you should always keep your position in the market. Try not to time it, as the market is irrational and short-term oriented.  What this means is that, instead of trying to buy during the dips and sell at all-time highs, which is in fact quite an impossible feat, you should rather keep your money invested in the companies you’ve thoroughly researched. Of course, you can time your entry points and recurring buys, if you see that there’s a significant dip for no fundamental reason and the market is just being irrational.  What I mean by fundamental reason is a change in the company’s fundamentals. Aim to invest in mature businesses, with high-profit margins compared to their operational income, high employee satisfaction, high customer retention and recurrence, and if possible, ownership of patents and scale distribution mechanisms. These aspects are valuable in any analysis, as they determine not just the present value of an enterprise, but its future prospects. ",
