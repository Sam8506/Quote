Viruses first surfaced in the 1980s, spreading via shared floppy discs on computers such as the Commodore 64 and Apple II.Viruses didn’t become a significant problem until the advent of the IBM PC. Unlike earlier computers, the PC was “open” – other manufacturers could build compatible computers and accessories, and anyone could write programs for it.With accessories such as modems and network cards, PC users accessed online file-sharing services such as bulletin board systems (BBSs). In the early 1990s, BBSs provided the main vector for the next generation of malware – file viruses. These viruses infected program files on MS-DOS operating systems and, later, on Windows. When the internet gained traction, email and FTP file sharing offered additional infection routes.Malware is the umbrella term for invasive programs such as viruses, worms and trojans.
